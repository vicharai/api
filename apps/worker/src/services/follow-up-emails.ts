Thanks for signing up for LLM Gateway! We noticed you haven't added any credits yet.

With credits you can access 300+ AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API. Here's how to get started:

1. Log in at https://llmgateway.io/dashboard
2. Add credits under Settings > Billing
3. Create an API key
4. Start making requests using the OpenAI-compatible API

Read our quickstart here: https://docs.llmgateway.io/quick-start

If you have any questions, just reply to this email and we'll be happy to help.

Best,
The LLM Gateway Team`,

We noticed you added credits to your LLM Gateway account a few days ago but haven't used much yet.

If you're having trouble getting started, here are some resources:

- Getting started in 5 minutes: https://llmgateway.io/blog/getting-started-in-5-minutes
- Documentation: https://docs.llmgateway.io
- Lounge: https://lounge.llmgateway.io (test models without writing code)

If something isn't working as expected or you need help with your setup, reply to this email and we'll get you sorted out.

You've been making great use of LLM Gateway! We noticed your credits are getting low and you haven't topped up in a while.

To keep your API access running smoothly, you can:

1. Top up credits: https://llmgateway.io/dashboard
2. Enable auto top-up under Settings > Billing so you never run out

If there's anything we can improve, we'd love to hear your feedback. Just reply to this email.
