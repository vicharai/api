# Airside — What It Costs To List

Last updated: 2026-09-13

> Airside is the carrier console where an AI model provider lists its models on Vichar. There is no subscription and no minimum volume: you set the prices developers pay, you choose the gateway margin you accept, and you share margin only on traffic you win.

## Listing a carrier

- Price: a one-time $2,500 listing fee per provider company on app.vichar.io, charged via Stripe, payable before a claim is approved. Non-refundable, including if the claim is later rejected or revoked. (Self-hosted deployments without a configured fee list for free.)
- Providers we already work with can skip the fee with an invite code we share with them — entered during onboarding instead of paying.
- Recurring platform fee: none.
- Minimum volume or revenue commitment: none.
- One listing covers your whole team: invite up to 10 crew members to the console.

## What you charge

- You set per-token input and output prices, and optionally a cached-input price and a flat per-request price.
- Your filed price is what developers are billed for requests routed to your models. Vichar does not mark your token prices up.
- Prices change only through an approved tariff filing. The previously approved price stays in effect until the new filing is approved.

## What you keep

- You keep your billed traffic less the gateway margin you accept.
- The margin is a control in your console, not a fixed rate: raising the margin you accept improves your routing score, lowering it keeps more revenue per request.
- An optional traffic discount lowers your effective price in the routing election and, once approved, the price developers are billed for your models. It is shown on your model cards, and you keep the discounted billed traffic less the margin you accept.
- Margin and discount changes are filed like tariffs: they are reviewed by the Vichar team and only reach routing once approved.
- The console reports traffic, not amounts owed. Settlement — schedule, currency, minimums — is governed by a separate written agreement.

## How traffic is allocated

- Every request runs a routing election across eligible providers. The lowest score wins.
- Scored on: price after your discount and accepted margin (heaviest weight), availability, prompt-cache support, throughput, then latency to first token.
- No paid placement: ranking cannot be bought outside these mechanics, and no traffic volume is guaranteed.
- Developers can pin a provider or disable fallback, which overrides automatic selection.

## Requirements

- A verified company email whose registrable domain matches your API endpoint's domain or published website. Free and disposable email domains are rejected.
- An OpenAI-compatible endpoint you operate.
- Claims and initial listings are reviewed by the Vichar team before going live.
