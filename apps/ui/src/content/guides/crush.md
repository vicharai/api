[Crush](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush) is a terminal coding agent. Connect its OpenAI-compatible provider to LLM Gateway with a pay-as-you-go or DevPass key.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add -g @charmland/crush
crush --version
```

Other installation options are in the&nbsp;[Crush documentation](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush#installation).

## Connect LLM Gateway

Create an API key in your&nbsp;[dashboard](https://app.vichar.io/dashboard), then export it in the terminal where you run Crush:

```bash
export LLMGATEWAY_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

Add this provider to your project's `crush.json`, merging it with existing settings:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "llmgateway": {
      "name": "LLM Gateway",
      "type": "openai",
      "base_url": "https://api.vichar.io/v1",
      "api_key": "$LLMGATEWAY_API_KEY"
    }
  }
}
```

The key stays in your environment. Crush discovers the available models from the gateway when no explicit model list is configured.

## Choose a model and code

```bash
cd your-project
crush
```

Select **LLM Gateway** and a model with tool support from the&nbsp;[live catalogue](https://app.vichar.io/models?features=tools). With DevPass, choose a canonical model ID supported by your plan, without an upstream provider prefix.

Start with a small task that has a clear test. Review tool permission requests, inspect the changes, and run the tests. Check usage in the workspace that issued your API key.

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication failed:** Check that `LLMGATEWAY_API_KEY` is exported in the same terminal and the key is active.
- **Models missing:** Restart Crush after editing the provider configuration. Check the endpoint and key before adding a manual model list.
- **Tool calls fail:** Confirm the selected model supports tools.
- **Provider unavailable:** Gateway fallback can route requests to another eligible provider. See the&nbsp;[routing documentation](https://docs.vichar.io/features/routing) for pinning and fallback controls.

See the&nbsp;[Crush configuration reference](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush/tree/main/docs/config) for permissions and additional settings.
