description: Connect Pi to LLM Gateway with a custom provider, keep your key in an environment variable, and verify a coding task.

[Pi](https://pi.dev) is a terminal coding agent with tools for reading files, editing code, and running commands. Add LLM Gateway as a custom provider to choose from the&nbsp;[live model catalogue](https://app.vichar.io/models) and track usage in one dashboard.

This setup was verified with Pi 0.85.1, including file edits and a successful test run.

## Install Pi

Install the current package:

```bash
pnpm add -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
pi --version
```

The older `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` package is deprecated. See the&nbsp;[Pi website](https://pi.dev) for installation options.

## Configure the provider

Create an API key in your&nbsp;[LLM Gateway dashboard](https://app.vichar.io/dashboard), then set it in the shell where you will run Pi:

```bash
export LLMGATEWAY_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

Add this provider to `~/.pi/agent/models.json`. Merge it with any existing providers:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "llmgateway": {
      "baseUrl": "https://api.vichar.io/v1",
      "api": "openai-completions",
      "apiKey": "$LLMGATEWAY_API_KEY",
      "headers": { "x-source": "pi" },
      "models": [
        {
          "id": "deepseek-v4-flash",
          "reasoning": true,
          "contextWindow": 1050000,
          "maxTokens": 4096
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The model is a working example. Choose a text model with tool support from the&nbsp;[models page](https://app.vichar.io/models), and use its exact ID. Match `reasoning` and `contextWindow` to the selected model. This example caps the response at 4,096 tokens with `maxTokens`.

**Keep the `$` in `"$LLMGATEWAY_API_KEY"`.** Current Pi interpolates environment variables only with `$NAME` or `${NAME}`. A plain `"LLMGATEWAY_API_KEY"` is sent as the literal key and causes an authentication error.

> **Using DevPass?** Use a canonical model ID without an upstream provider prefix. Coding plans let the gateway select the serving provider.

## Select the model

Start Pi from your project directory and open the model picker:

```bash
pi
```

Type `/model`, then choose the LLM Gateway model. Pi reloads `models.json` when you open the picker, so configuration changes do not require a restart.

You can also select the provider and model when launching:

```bash
pi --provider llmgateway --model deepseek-v4-flash
```

## Verify the connection

Give Pi a small task with a clear check:

```text
Fix slugify.ts so all tests pass. Read the files, make the smallest fix,
run node --test slugify.test.ts, and summarize. Do not edit the tests.
```

Inspect the resulting diff and test output. Requests appear in your&nbsp;[LLM Gateway dashboard](https://app.vichar.io/dashboard), with the model, token usage, and cost.

For a one-shot command:

```bash
pi --provider llmgateway --model deepseek-v4-flash -p "Explain this project"
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication error:** Check that the shell variable is set, the key is active, and `apiKey` includes the `$` prefix.
- **Model missing:** Copy its exact ID from the live catalogue, then reopen `/model`.
- **Wrong endpoint:** Use `https://api.vichar.io/v1` with `api: "openai-completions"`.
- **Unsupported reasoning setting:** Match the model's reasoning support and supported effort levels.

See Pi's&nbsp;[custom provider documentation](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/docs/models.md) for advanced configuration.
