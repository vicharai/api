[Kilo Code](https://kilo.ai/) is a coding agent for VS Code. Its provider settings include separate LLM Gateway and DevPass connections.

## Install and choose permissions

Install **Kilo Code** from the&nbsp;[VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kilocode.kilo-code), then open its sidebar panel.

On first launch, choose how much autonomy to allow. **Review First** lets you inspect edits and shell commands before approving them. Start with a small project and a focused task.

## Connect your workspace

1. Open Kilo's **Settings**, then **Providers**.
2. Click **Show more providers** and search for `llm`.
3. Choose **LLM Gateway** for pay-as-you-go usage or **DevPass (LLM Gateway)** for a coding plan.
4. Paste a key from the matching workspace dashboard and submit it.

The built-in provider supplies the endpoint; you do not need to enter a base URL.

## Select the model for this chat

Click the model picker at the bottom of the chat and select a tool-capable model from your connected provider. Check the active model before sending a task: setting a default under **Settings > Models** does not necessarily change an already-open chat.

Use the&nbsp;[live model catalogue](https://app.vichar.io/models?features=tools) to check capabilities. For DevPass, choose a canonical model ID included in your plan; upstream provider prefixes pin routing and are not supported on coding plans.

## Verify a coding task

Ask Kilo to inspect a function, fix a failing test case, and run the existing tests without changing them. In **Review First** mode, inspect the proposed diff and use **Allow once** for the edit and test command when appropriate.

Review the command output and final diff. The key determines which workspace receives the requests; inspect usage in that workspace's dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

**The provider is missing:** expand **Show more providers**, search for `llm`, and check that Kilo is current.

**The chat still uses another provider:** select the model in the chat itself, even if you already changed the default in Settings.

**Authentication fails:** verify that the key is active and matches the selected billing mode.

**A task pauses:** check whether Kilo is waiting for permission to edit a file or run a command.
