[Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) supports custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints. This walkthrough was verified with Hermes Agent 0.21.0.

## Install

Follow the&nbsp;[official installation instructions](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent#installation), then open a new terminal and check:

```bash
hermes --version
```

## Configure the connection

Run `hermes setup` and choose **Custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint**. Enter:

| Setting          | Value                                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Base URL         | `https://api.vichar.io/v1`                                   |
| API key          | A key from your [dashboard](https://app.vichar.io/dashboard) |
| Model            | `deepseek-v4-flash`                                          |
| Terminal backend | `local` for this walkthrough                                 |

You can also configure the files directly. Merge the following into `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
model:
  provider: custom
  default: deepseek-v4-flash
  base_url: https://api.vichar.io/v1
terminal:
  backend: local
```

Store the credentials in `~/.hermes/.env`:

```dotenv
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.vichar.io/v1
```

Keep the credentials file private. `HERMES_HOME` can point Hermes at a separate configuration directory.

## Start coding

```bash
cd your-project
hermes chat
```

For a single task that exits when finished:

```bash
hermes chat --oneshot -q "Fix the failing test and run it again"
```

Use `--toolsets terminal,file` to limit this demo to shell and file tools. You can change the model for a session with `--model`.

## Verify the connection

Open a small project and ask the agent to read a file, make a change, and run its tests. Our recorded example fixes a TypeScript slugifier and passes all three tests with `deepseek-v4-flash` through LLM Gateway.

`Hello, LLM Gateway!` becomes `hello-llm-gateway`; repeated separators collapse into one hyphen; empty and punctuation-only inputs stay empty. The demo uses Node.js 24 to run `node --test slugify.test.ts` directly.

Review the diff and test output, then check the request in your&nbsp;[LLM Gateway dashboard](https://app.vichar.io/dashboard). Choose other compatible models from the&nbsp;[live catalogue](https://app.vichar.io/models?features=tools).

## Troubleshooting

Run `hermes doctor` to inspect the configuration. Missing credentials for optional providers do not prevent your configured custom endpoint from working.

If requests use another provider, check both `model.provider: custom` and `model.base_url`. If TypeScript tests fail before running, check the Node.js version inside Hermes's terminal tool; it can differ from the version in your outer shell.
