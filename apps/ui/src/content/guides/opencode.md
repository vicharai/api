description: Use OpenCode's built-in LLM Gateway provider, choose a model, and verify your connection with a coding task.

[OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) is an open-source coding agent for your terminal, desktop, and editor. LLM Gateway is a built-in provider, with usage tracked in your gateway dashboard.

This walkthrough was verified with OpenCode 1.18.27, including a file edit and a successful test run.

## Install

Use the&nbsp;[OpenCode download page](https://opencode.ai/download) for your platform, or install the CLI:

```bash
pnpm add -g opencode-ai
opencode --version
```

## Connect your API key

Start OpenCode in your project:

```bash
opencode
```

Run `/connect`, search for **LLM Gateway**, and enter a key from your&nbsp;[LLM Gateway dashboard](https://app.vichar.io/dashboard). OpenCode saves credentials for later sessions.

Open `/models` to choose a model. Browse the&nbsp;[live catalogue](https://app.vichar.io/models) for current capabilities and pricing.

> **Using DevPass?** Select a canonical model ID without an upstream provider prefix. Provider-pinned routing is not available on coding plans.

## Configure with an environment variable

For scripts or a project-specific configuration, set your key:

```bash
export LLMGATEWAY_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

Add an `opencode.json` in the project root:

```json
{
  "provider": {
    "llmgateway": {
      "options": {
        "apiKey": "{env:LLMGATEWAY_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  },
  "model": "llmgateway/deepseek-v4-flash"
}
```

`llmgateway` is OpenCode's provider ID. The rest of the `model` string is the gateway model ID. The example uses the model tested in this walkthrough; replace it with one from the live catalogue.

The provider already defines the gateway endpoint, so this configuration only supplies the key and model. For a custom endpoint override, use `provider.llmgateway.options.baseURL` with `https://api.vichar.io/v1`.

## Verify a coding task

Ask OpenCode to fix a specific file and run its tests:

```text
Fix slugify.ts so all tests pass. Read the files, make the smallest fix,
run node --test slugify.test.ts, and summarize. Do not edit the tests.
```

Review the diff, approve commands as needed, and check the test output. Then confirm the request's model, tokens, and cost in your&nbsp;[dashboard](https://app.vichar.io/dashboard).

You can also run a one-shot task:

```bash
opencode run --model llmgateway/deepseek-v4-flash "Explain this project"
```

## Switching models

Use `/models` in the terminal, or list the provider's available IDs:

```bash
opencode models llmgateway
```

Copy an exact ID from that output into the `model` field or the `--model` option. Canonical IDs let the gateway choose the upstream provider; provider-prefixed IDs select a specific deployment when your account supports pinned routing.

## Troubleshooting

### Provider not found

Check `opencode --version` and run `opencode models llmgateway`. The verified version uses `llmgateway`; older instructions referring to `llmgateway-providers` may not match your installed release.

### Authentication error

Check that the key is active and available in the shell that launches OpenCode. The environment reference uses OpenCode's `{env:VARIABLE_NAME}` syntax.

### Model missing

Refresh the model picker or restart OpenCode. Copy the exact ID from `opencode models llmgateway` and compare it with the&nbsp;[gateway catalogue](https://app.vichar.io/models).

See&nbsp;[OpenCode's provider documentation](https://opencode.ai/docs/providers/#llm-gateway) for additional configuration options.
