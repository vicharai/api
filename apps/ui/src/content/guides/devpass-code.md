[DevPass Code](https://github.com/theopenco/devpass-code) is a terminal coding agent built for LLM Gateway. This walkthrough was verified with DevPass Code 1.18.11.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add -g devpass-code
devpass-code --version
```

See the&nbsp;[project repository](https://github.com/theopenco/devpass-code) for other installation options.

## Connect LLM Gateway

The recorded walkthrough uses an existing gateway API key:

```bash
export LLMGATEWAY_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

Create your key in the&nbsp;[dashboard](https://app.vichar.io/dashboard). Alternatively, run `devpass-code auth login`, choose **LLM Gateway** or **LLM Gateway DevPass**, and follow the browser-login or key-entry flow.

Browser login creates a credential and returns it to the tool through a local callback. If you have reached your organization's active-key limit, manage your keys in the dashboard before retrying.

## Choose a model

Place a `devpass-code.json` in your project:

```json
{
  "model": "llmgateway/deepseek-v4-flash"
}
```

Then launch the agent:

```bash
cd your-project
devpass-code
```

You can also select the model with `--model llmgateway/deepseek-v4-flash` or use the model picker. Browse the&nbsp;[live catalogue](https://app.vichar.io/models?features=tools) for other coding models.

The `llmgateway/` prefix identifies the agent's provider. The remaining model ID is canonical, which is also the form required for&nbsp;[DevPass](https://devpass.vichar.io) plan routing.

## Verify the connection

Open a small project and ask the agent to read a file, make a change, and run its tests. Our recorded example fixes a TypeScript slugifier and passes all three tests with `deepseek-v4-flash` through LLM Gateway.

`Hello, LLM Gateway!` becomes `hello-llm-gateway`; repeated separators collapse into one hyphen; empty and punctuation-only inputs stay empty. The demo uses Node.js 24 to run `node --test slugify.test.ts` directly.

Review the diff and test output, then check the request in your&nbsp;[LLM Gateway dashboard](https://app.vichar.io/dashboard). Choose other compatible models from the&nbsp;[live catalogue](https://app.vichar.io/models?features=tools).

## Troubleshooting

Check that `LLMGATEWAY_API_KEY` is available to the process and that the model ID matches the picker. If a project opens with an unexpected model, check its `devpass-code.json` and pass `--model` explicitly.

DevPass Code tags requests with `x-source: devpass-code` for attribution in your dashboard.
