## How the Discounts Work

LLM Gateway negotiates volume-based pricing with infrastructure providers and passes the savings directly to you. When you send a request for a DeepSeek model, our smart routing engine:

1. **Identifies all available providers** for that model
2. **Applies any negotiated discounts** to each provider's base price
3. **Routes to the cheapest option** that supports your request's features (tool calling, JSON mode, etc.)
4. **Falls back automatically** if the primary provider is unavailable

You pay the discounted rate. We charge zero platform markup on top.

## Stacking Discounts: DeepSeek Cache + LLM Gateway Partner Pricing

DeepSeek's official API already offers a **90% discount on cached input tokens** — $0.028/M instead of $0.28/M for prompt cache hits. When you access DeepSeek through LLM Gateway's discounted providers, you can stack both savings:

| Scenario                          | Input Cost (per 1M) | Savings vs. Official |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| Official DeepSeek API             | $0.28               | —                    |
| Official + cache hit              | $0.028              | 90%                  |
| LLM Gateway (Canopywave, 30% off) | $0.182              | 35%                  |
| LLM Gateway + cache hit           | $0.036              | 87%                  |

Even with cache hits factored in, LLM Gateway's discounted providers offer competitive pricing — and you get automatic failover, usage analytics, and multi-provider routing on top.

## Cost Comparison: 1M Requests

To put the discounts in perspective, here's what 1 million typical requests (1K input tokens + 200 output tokens each) would cost:

| Provider                     | Cost per 1M Requests | Annual Savings vs. Official |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| DeepSeek (Official)          | $364                 | —                           |
| LLM Gateway (Novita)         | $349                 | $180                        |
| LLM Gateway (Alibaba)        | $299                 | $780                        |
| **LLM Gateway (Canopywave)** | **$238**             | **$1,512**                  |

That's over **$1,500 saved per year** on a single model at moderate volume. Scale up to 10M requests/day and you're looking at five-figure annual savings.

## Why We Offer Discounts

Most API gateways add a markup on top of provider pricing. We don't. LLM Gateway is funded through optional paid plans (Pro and Enterprise) that offer features like extended data retention, provider key management, and priority support.

For API routing and model access, you pay exactly what the provider charges — or less, when we've negotiated a discount. It's that simple.
