Claude Code works great with Claude—but what if you want to use GPT-5, Gemini, or a cheaper model for simple tasks? With LLM Gateway, you can point Claude Code at any model in our catalog. Three environment variables. No code changes.

## Why Use LLM Gateway with Claude Code?

- **Use any model** — GPT-5, Gemini, Llama, or 180+ others with tool calling support
- **Cut costs** — Use GPT-4o Mini for routine tasks, Claude Opus for complex reasoning
- **Track everything** — See exactly what each coding session costs in your dashboard
- **One config** — Same setup works for all models, no provider-specific changes

## Quick Setup

Set three environment variables and you're ready to go:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://api.vichar.io
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=llmgtwy_.... # your app.vichar.io api key here
# optionally, choose your model, otherwise it will use the default Claude model via LLMGateway
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL=gpt-5 # choose your model on llmgateway which supports tool calls

# now run claude!
claude
```

### Get Your API Key

1. [Sign up free](https://app.vichar.io/signup) — no credit card required
2. Create a project and generate an API key
3. Start using it immediately (we provide model access, no provider keys needed)

### Popular Models for Claude Code

| `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514` | Balanced performance and cost               | $$   |
| `gpt-4o-mini`                        | Routine tasks, cost-conscious usage         | $    |
| `glm-4.5v`                           | Similar quality, 50-70% cheaper than Claude | $    |

## Advanced Configuration

### Model Switching

You can easily switch models by updating the environment variable:

```bash
# Switch to GPT-4o Mini for cost savings
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini

# Switch to Claude Sonnet for complex reasoning
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
```

To see the full list of models available to you, check out [models with tool calls](https://app.vichar.io/models?filters=1&tools=true)

### Persistent Configuration

Add the environment variables to your shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or `.profile`) for persistent configuration:

```bash
echo 'export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://api.vichar.io' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=llmgtwy_your_key_here' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export ANTHROPIC_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

## What You Get

### Cost Visibility

Every Claude Code session is tracked in your dashboard. See exactly how many tokens you used, what it cost, and which model performed best. No more surprise bills.

### Automatic Failover

If OpenAI goes down, LLM Gateway routes to a backup provider. Your coding session continues uninterrupted.

### One Bill for Everything

Instead of managing credits across Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google, you get one account, one dashboard, one invoice.

## Get Started

1. [Sign up free](https://app.vichar.io/signup) — takes 30 seconds
2. Grab your API key from the dashboard
3. Set the three environment variables above
4. Run `claude` and start coding with any model
