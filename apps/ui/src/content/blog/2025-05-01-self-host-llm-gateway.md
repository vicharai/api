Want full control over your LLM infrastructure? Self-host LLM Gateway on your own servers—keep your data in-house, avoid platform fees, and customize everything. Here's how to get running in under 5 minutes.

## Option 1: Unified Docker Image (Easiest)

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name llmgateway \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 3002:3002 -p 3003:3003 -p 3005:3005 -p 3006:3006 -p 4001:4001 -p 4002:4002 \
  -v ~/llmgateway_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -e AUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here \
  -e GATEWAY_API_KEY_HASH_SECRET=your-api-key-hash-secret-here \
  ghcr.io/theopenco/llmgateway-unified:latest
```

One command. All services. Running in seconds.

> **Tip:** Pin to a specific release tag (e.g., `v1.2.3`) in production to avoid unexpected updates.

## Option 2: Split Services via Docker Compose

For more control over individual services (useful for scaling or debugging):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vicharai/api.git
cd llmgateway
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env
docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.split.yml up -d
```

### Access Your Instance

Once running, your services are available at:

| Service    | URL                   | Description                    |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Web UI     | http://localhost:3002 | Dashboard and analytics        |
| Playground | http://localhost:3003 | Chat playground                |
| Docs       | http://localhost:3005 | Local documentation            |
| Admin      | http://localhost:3006 | Platform administration        |
| API        | http://localhost:4002 | Management API                 |
| Gateway    | http://localhost:4001 | LLM request gateway (use this) |

## What You Get

- **Zero platform fees** — No percentage taken from your API spend
- **Data sovereignty** — All requests stay on your infrastructure
- **Unlimited customization** — Modify the codebase to fit your needs
- **Same features** — Analytics, caching, and routing work just like the hosted version
