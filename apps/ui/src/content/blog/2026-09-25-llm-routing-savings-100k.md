title: "LLM Cost Optimization at $100k a Month"
summary: "A worked model of LLM cost optimization for a team spending $100k a month: what difficulty-based model routing saves at three traffic mixes, what the classifier costs, and the break-even point. Real catalogue prices, explicit assumptions, and the arithmetic to run on your own numbers."
categories: ["Guides", "Engineering"]
faqs:
  - question: "How much can LLM routing actually save?"
    answer: "It depends on what fraction of your traffic is easy enough for a cheaper model. Moving from a single pinned frontier model to a difficulty-routed mix of Claude Haiku, Sonnet and Opus saves roughly 36% at a conservative mix and 60% at an aggressive one, on 2k-in/500-out requests at list prices. Against a Sonnet baseline the range is about 9% to 33%. Your number depends on your own difficulty distribution, which you should measure rather than assume."
  - question: "What does the classifier itself cost?"
    answer: "TypeSafe's Jev model is $0.042 per million input tokens, with output priced at zero. A classification runs about 1,100 to 4,000 input tokens depending on how long the request is and how many models you configured, so roughly $0.0001 per call — about 10,000 classifications per dollar. At $100k a month it lands between $50 and $800 depending on request volume and whether you use sticky sessions. It is billed to your account as its own log entry against the project and API key that triggered it, so the figure is measured rather than estimated."
  - question: "When is routing not worth it?"
    answer: "When your traffic is uniformly hard, when your average request is so cheap that the classifier is a large fraction of it, or when a wrong model choice is expensive in ways the bill does not show. Routing moves a quality risk onto the cheaper model for part of your traffic, so measure output quality on the band you push down, not just the invoice."
  - question: "Does the classifier run on every request?"
    answer: "Only when you enable it, and a request carrying a session id is classified once for the whole conversation. For agent and chat traffic that divides the classifier cost by your average turn count, which is usually what makes it a rounding error."

If you spend $100,000 a month on inference, the largest line item is usually
not a model that is too expensive. It is a model that is too expensive **for
part of your traffic**. The same endpoint answers "reword this paragraph" and
"find the race condition in this scheduler", and if you pinned a frontier model
to be safe, you are paying frontier prices for the first one several million
times a month.

This post is a worked model of **LLM cost optimization** through difficulty-based
routing at that scale. Every price below is the current list price from the
[LLM Gateway catalogue](https://app.vichar.io/models); every assumption is
stated so you can substitute your own.

## The assumptions, stated up front

This is a model, not a measurement. It rests on four things, and if any of them
are wrong for you the answer changes:

- **A representative request is 2,000 input tokens and 500 output tokens.** Long
  context shifts the arithmetic toward input price; heavy generation shifts it
  toward output.
- **Prices are Anthropic first-party list prices**, as served through the gateway.
- **Traffic mixes are illustrative.** The whole result hinges on what fraction of
  your requests are genuinely easy, and that is the number you should measure
  rather than borrow from a blog post.
- **Quality is held constant by assumption.** In reality, routing trades some
  quality risk on the traffic you push down. More on that at the end.

At those token counts the three models cost:

| Model             | Input / output per 1M | Cost per request |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- |
| Claude Haiku 4.5  | $1.00 / $5.00         | $0.0045          |
| Claude Sonnet 4.6 | $3.00 / $15.00        | $0.0135          |
| Claude Opus 4.6   | $5.00 / $25.00        | $0.0225          |

## Case 1: you pinned the frontier model

$100,000 a month at $0.0225 a request is about **4.4 million requests**. Now
route them by difficulty instead, into Low / Medium / High bands backed by those
three models:

| Traffic mix (Haiku / Sonnet / Opus) | Inference | Classifier | Net saving        |
| ----------------------------------- | --------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| Conservative — 20 / 50 / 30         | $64,000   | $467       | **$35,500 (36%)** |
| Typical — 40 / 40 / 20              | $52,000   | $467       | **$47,500 (48%)** |
| Aggressive — 60 / 30 / 10           | $40,000   | $467       | **$59,500 (60%)** |

Even the conservative mix — where 30% of traffic still goes to Opus and only a
fifth drops to Haiku — takes a third off the bill. The classifier is under half
a percent of the saving in every row.

## Case 2: you pinned the mid-tier model

Pinning Sonnet is the more common starting point, and the honest one to model,
because the headline number is smaller. $100,000 at $0.0135 is about **7.4
million requests**, and now routing cuts both ways: some traffic moves down to
Haiku, but some moves _up_ to Opus.

| Traffic mix (Haiku / Sonnet / Opus) | Inference | Classifier | Net saving        |
| ----------------------------------- | --------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| Conservative — 30 / 55 / 15         | $90,000   | $778       | **$9,200 (9%)**   |
| Typical — 45 / 40 / 15              | $80,000   | $778       | **$19,200 (19%)** |
| Aggressive — 60 / 30 / 10           | $66,700   | $778       | **$32,600 (33%)** |

Smaller, but note what you are buying alongside it: 15% of your traffic now
reaches a frontier model it previously did not. That is a quality gain you were
not getting before, paid for out of the savings on the easy half.

## What the classifier costs

[TypeSafe's Jev](https://docs.vichar.io/features/routing) decision model is
**$0.042 per million input tokens, with output priced at zero**. One
classification is the rubric plus a bounded slice of the request:

| Scenario                          | Input tokens | Cost per call |
| --------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Short prompt, 3 configured models | ~1,100       | $0.000046     |
| Mid prompt, ~10 models            | ~2,500       | $0.000105     |
| Capped state, 30 models           | ~4,000       | $0.000168     |

About **$0.0001 a call, or 10,000 classifications per dollar**. Each call is
billed to your account as its own log entry, against the same project and API
key as the request that triggered it — so the line above is something you can
read off your own usage rather than a figure you have to model. The rubric grows
with your model list — each configured model contributes its name, description
and price band to the question — so a 30-model list costs roughly twice a
3-model list per call.

And a request carrying a session id is classified **once for the whole
conversation**, not once per turn. For agent or chat traffic averaging ten turns,
every classifier figure above divides by ten.

## The break-even is about 1%

The cleanest way to think about whether this is worth switching on:

> Moving one request from Sonnet to Haiku saves $0.009. A classification costs
> $0.000105. The classifier pays for itself if **more than about 1.2%** of your
> requests move down a band.

Below that threshold your traffic is uniformly hard and you should pin a model
and skip the classifier. Above it — and almost all mixed production traffic is
well above it — the classifier is noise against the saving. That asymmetry is
the actual argument for difficulty routing: the downside is bounded at a tenth
of a percent of spend, and the upside is tens of percent.

## Where this model is optimistic

Three honest caveats, because a savings estimate with no failure modes is a
sales pitch:

**Quality is not free.** Every request you push to a cheaper model is a bet that
the cheaper model handles it. A classifier makes that bet better than a coin
flip, but it does not make it free. Measure output quality on the traffic that
moves down, not just the invoice.

**Your mix is probably not ours.** The 40/40/20 row is an illustration. Run your
own traffic through a classifier in observe-only mode — point the Low and Medium
bands at the model you already use — and read the recorded difficulty
distribution off your logs before you change any routing.

**Cheap traffic changes the ratio.** These numbers assume a $0.0135–$0.0225
average request. If your average request costs $0.002, the classifier is around
5% of spend rather than 0.5%, and the case is weaker unless sessions amortize it.

## Running it

On LLM Gateway this is configuration, not code. Choose the models `smart` may
resolve to and the classifier, and the gateway sorts them into price bands and
routes each request to the matching one. Every decision — the difficulty, the
task type, the candidates, the model chosen — lands on the request's log entry,
so you can audit the mix you actually got against the mix you assumed here.

Smart routing itself carries no platform fee: you pay for the models it selects
and for each classifier call, at the rates above. A verdict reused from a sticky
session and a classifier call that fails are both charged nothing. It is
available to every organization including pay-as-you-go while it is in beta; it
is not available on DevPass yet. If you want the routing logic explicit instead, a
[dynamic route](https://docs.vichar.io/features/dynamic-routes) can branch on
the same verdict.
