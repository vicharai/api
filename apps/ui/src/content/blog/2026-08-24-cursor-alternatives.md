title: "9 Best Cursor Alternatives in 2026 (Compared)"
summary: "The best Cursor alternatives in 2026, compared honestly — AI editors, terminal agents, and gateway-backed setups. Where Cursor's credit pools and curated model list pinch, and which alternative fixes each complaint without breaking your workflow."
categories: ["Guides"]
faqs:
  - question: "Why do developers look for Cursor alternatives?"
    answer: "Three recurring reasons: the usage economics (Pro's $20 includes roughly $20 of API-rate usage — break-even — and heavy agent use continues pay-as-you-go), the curated model list of around 40 models someone else picks, and editor lock-in — the value of the subscription doesn't follow you to the terminal or another tool."
  - question: "What is the cheapest Cursor alternative?"
    answer: "Open-source tools — Cline, Continue, Aider, OpenCode — are free; you pay only tokens. Behind a flat-rate key like DevPass ($29–$179/month for ~3× usage at provider rates across 200+ models) the bill stays predictable. OpenCode Go is the cheapest hosted plan at $10/month, capped at $60 of usage."
  - question: "Can I keep Cursor but use different models?"
    answer: "Partly. Cursor's chat and plan panel accept a custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint and key, so you can run any of LLM Gateway's 200+ models there. Composer, inline edit, and tab autocomplete stay on Cursor's own backend regardless of settings — for a full agent loop on your own models, use Claude Code, Cline, or OpenCode."
  - question: "Is there an open-source alternative to Cursor?"
    answer: "Several, depending on which part of Cursor you want. Zed is an open-source editor with agentic editing. Cline and Continue are open agents inside VS Code (Continue also covers completions). OpenCode and Aider are open terminal agents. All of them accept any OpenAI-compatible key, including a gateway."

Cursor is the most popular AI editor for a reason: unlimited tab completion, the Composer agent, and Bugbot review in one polished VS Code fork. But the subscription has three seams that push people to look at Cursor alternatives in 2026 — and which alternative fits depends entirely on which seam is pinching you.

The seams, concretely: **the economics** (Pro's $20/month includes roughly $20 of API-rate usage — break-even — with Ultra at $200 reaching about 2×, and pay-as-you-go past the included amount), **the catalog** (a curated list of ~40 models someone else picks), and **the lock-in** (everything you pay for lives inside one editor — none of it follows you to the terminal, CI, or another tool).

We compared the nine alternatives developers actually switch to. We build one of them, so we're biased — but we'll tell you where each option genuinely wins, including where Cursor still does.

## What to Look for in a Cursor Alternative

1. **Which part of Cursor are you replacing?** The editor experience (tab completion, inline edit) or the model access (chat, agents)? Most "alternatives" only replace one.
2. **Flat or metered?** Flat plans restore predictability; free tools plus token billing can be cheaper if you control routing.
3. **Whose models?** Curated lists are convenient until the model you want isn't on them.
4. **Does the value travel?** A subscription tied to one app is worth less than a key that works in every tool you touch.

\*Any model when pointed at a gateway.

## 1. LLM Gateway (+ the agent of your choice)

**Best overall: replace the subscription, keep your tools.**

[LLM Gateway](https://app.vichar.io) isn't an editor — it's the layer Cursor bundles and hides. One OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible key runs any coding tool — Claude Code, Cline, Continue, Aider, OpenCode, Zed, or Cursor itself — against **200+ models**, with every request metered at the provider's published rate and shown in a real-dollar dashboard.

**What sets it apart:**

- **~3× usage value on flat plans** — [DevPass](https://devpass.vichar.io) turns $29/$79/$179 a month into roughly $87/$237/$537 of usage at provider rates. Cursor Pro is ~1×, Ultra ~2×
- **Every model, not a curated list** — Claude Opus 5, GPT-5.6, Gemini 3.1 Pro, plus the open-weight coders (GLM-5.2, Kimi K3, Qwen3.8), switchable mid-session
- **The value travels** — the same key works in your editor, your terminal agent, and CI
- **Transparent, capped spend** — real dollar costs per request, hard budget limits per org, project, and key
- **Open source (AGPLv3)** — self-host if you need to

**Pricing:** DevPass flat plans from $29/month; or pay-as-you-go at provider rates with a flat 5% credit fee (0% with your own provider keys).

**Best for:** Developers whose complaint is Cursor's model list or economics, not its editor. If you love tab completion, keep a cheap editor for it and move chat and agents here. ([Full DevPass vs Cursor comparison](https://devpass.vichar.io/compare/cursor).)

## 2. Windsurf

**The most direct editor swap.**

Windsurf is the other AI-native editor, built around its Cascade agent, and its 2026 pitch is pricing that stays flat rather than metering by credits.

**Strengths:**

- Familiar AI-editor experience: completions, chat, agent in one app
- Flat per-seat pricing that's easy to budget
- Capable autonomous features on the higher tier

**Weaknesses:**

- It's still an editor switch with a vendor-curated model list
- Value stays inside the app, same as Cursor
- Fewer governance controls than gateway-backed setups

**Pricing:** Pro $20/month; Max $200/month (as of July 2026).

**Best for:** Developers who like the Cursor formula but want a flatter bill.

---

## 3. Zed

**The open-source editor with AI built in — and your own keys welcome.**

Zed is a fast, open-source editor written in Rust with agentic editing built in. Unlike Cursor, it's happy to run on keys you bring — including a gateway key that unlocks every model.

**Strengths:**

- Genuinely fast, open-source editor — no fork of anything
- Agentic editing plus completions in the editor
- Bring your own OpenAI-compatible endpoint: [point it at LLM Gateway](https://app.vichar.io/models) and the whole catalog is available

**Weaknesses:**

- Younger extension ecosystem than VS Code forks
- AI features are newer than Cursor's and still catching up in polish
- Hosted-model plans exist, but the BYOK path is where it shines

**Pricing:** Free, open-source editor; you pay for tokens on your own key.

**Best for:** Developers who want editor speed, open source, and full model freedom in one move.

---

## 4. VS Code + GitHub Copilot

**The default you may already have.**

Plain VS Code with Copilot is the boring alternative: the editor Cursor forked, with Microsoft's assistant on top. Since June 2026, Copilot bills chat and agents through usage-based AI Credits on top of the $10–$39 seat.

**Strengths:**

- No editor migration at all — Cursor users are already at home in VS Code
- Excellent inline completions, still effectively flat-fee
- Enterprise procurement already approves it

**Weaknesses:**

- AI Credits meter chat and agent usage with no default ceiling — the [same complaint that drives Copilot switchers](/blog/github-copilot-alternatives)
- Curated model menu
- Agent mode trails dedicated CLI agents for long autonomous runs

**Pricing:** Free tier; Pro $10/month, Pro+ $39/month, plus usage-based AI Credits.

**Best for:** Teams standardized on GitHub who mostly want completions.

---

## 5. Claude Code

**The strongest single agent — no editor required.**

Claude Code is Anthropic's terminal-native agent, and for long, multi-file agentic work it's the reference point. It replaces Cursor's Composer, not its editor.

**Strengths:**

- Best-in-class agentic coding on flat monthly plans
- Lives in the terminal — works alongside any editor, including Cursor
- Pointed at [a gateway](/blog/how-configure-claude-code-with-llmgateway), it runs GPT, Gemini, GLM or any of 200+ models, not just Claude

**Weaknesses:**

- Anthropic models only out of the box
- No completions — pair it with something for the editor surface
- Heavy users hit plan windows on the native plans

**Pricing:** Pro $20/month; Max tiers from $100/month (as of July 2026).

**Best for:** Developers whose real Cursor usage is "agent does the work" — the terminal agent does it better.

---

## 6. OpenCode

**The open-source terminal agent with a built-in gateway.**

OpenCode is an MIT-licensed terminal agent from the team that now also sells the [OpenCode Go plan](/blog/opencode-go-pricing). It's provider-agnostic by design — and [LLM Gateway ships as a built-in provider](/blog/opencode-built-in-provider), so setup is a login and a model pick.

**Strengths:**

- Free, open source, fast TUI with agents, tools, and MCP support
- Any provider; gateway-native without touching a URL
- Go subscription ($10/month, $60 usage cap) if you want hosted open models cheap

**Weaknesses:**

- Terminal-only; no completions or editor surface
- Go's hosted catalog caps frontier models at $15/month each and includes no Claude or Gemini
- Younger than Aider or Cline

**Pricing:** Free tool; tokens via your key, or OpenCode Go at $10/month.

**Best for:** Terminal-first developers who want an open agent and model freedom.

---

## 7. Cline

**Cursor's agent powers, open source, inside stock VS Code.**

Cline is the open-source VS Code agent: multi-file edits, terminal commands, browser use — on whatever key you hand it.

**Strengths:**

- Free software; total cost is your token spend
- Stays in VS Code — no editor migration
- Any model via an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, [including a gateway](/guides/cline) for caps and analytics

**Weaknesses:**

- No bundled allowance — raw token billing needs a budget in front of it
- Setup and model choice are on you
- Completions depend on a separate extension

**Pricing:** Free; you pay for tokens.

**Best for:** VS Code users who want Composer-style agent work with full cost control.

---

## 8. Continue

**The open option that also replaces tab completion.**

Continue is Apache-licensed, runs in VS Code and JetBrains, and is one of the few open tools that covers completions as well as chat and agents — the full Cursor surface.

**Strengths:**

- Completions + chat + agents, open source
- JetBrains support — rare in this list
- One [config file pointed at a gateway](/guides/continue) unlocks every model

**Weaknesses:**

- Completion quality depends on your model and latency budget
- More configuration than a packaged editor
- Team features are young

**Pricing:** Free and open source; you pay for tokens.

**Best for:** Dropping the Cursor subscription entirely — completions included — without leaving your IDE.

---

## 9. Aider

**Minimalist pair programming, git-native.**

Aider is the veteran open-source terminal agent: every change lands as a clean commit, and it scripts into CI trivially.

**Strengths:**

- Free, mature, model-agnostic
- Git-native diffs you can actually review
- Scriptable for automation

**Weaknesses:**

- Terminal-only, no completions
- Less autonomous than Claude Code or Cline on long tasks
- Keys and spend are yours to manage — unless a gateway fronts it

**Pricing:** Free; you pay for tokens.

**Best for:** Developers who want a fast, predictable pair programmer with readable version control.

---

## How to Choose

**Your complaint is the model list or the credit math, not the editor:** keep your editor and move the model layer to [LLM Gateway](https://app.vichar.io) — flat DevPass plans or pass-through billing, every model, one key that works everywhere. You can even point Cursor's own chat panel at it.

**You want another finished AI editor:** Windsurf for the flattest bill, Zed if open source and speed matter.

**You want the agent, not the editor:** Claude Code for the strongest single agent, OpenCode or Aider for open-source terminal work, Cline for staying inside VS Code.

**You want to spend as little as possible:** free open tools plus a cheap default model. Continue if you need completions too; [OpenCode Go](/blog/opencode-go-pricing) at $10/month if your usage fits under $60.

Whichever you pick, the full plan-by-plan pricing breakdown is in the [best AI coding plans ranking](/blog/best-ai-coding-plans).
