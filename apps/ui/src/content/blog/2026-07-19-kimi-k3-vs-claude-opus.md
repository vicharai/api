title: "Kimi K3 vs Claude Opus 4.8: Benchmarks, Price, Verdict"
summary: "Kimi K3 ties Claude Opus 4.8 on GPQA Diamond, costs 40% less per token, and its weights are public while Opus stays closed — but Opus still leads where it counts for some teams. A fact-checked comparison of benchmarks, pricing, and context windows, and how to A/B both through one API."
categories: ["Guides"]
model: kimi-k3
faqs:
  - question: "Is Kimi K3 as good as Claude Opus 4.8?"
    answer: "On aggregate intelligence benchmarks, yes — Artificial Analysis ranks them level, and they are statistically tied on GPQA Diamond. On production coding-agent work, Opus 4.8 still has the deeper published record (88.6% SWE-bench Verified) and the more mature harness ecosystem. On frontend code generation, blind developer testing ranked K3 first."
  - question: "How much cheaper is Kimi K3 than Claude Opus 4.8?"
    answer: "40% on every token class: $3.00 vs $5.00 per million input, $0.30 vs $0.50 cached, $15.00 vs $25.00 output."
  - question: "Can I switch between Kimi K3 and Claude Opus 4.8 without code changes?"
    answer: "Yes. Through LLM Gateway both are the same OpenAI-compatible endpoint — swap the `model` field between `kimi-k3` and `claude-opus-4-8` and nothing else changes. Costs for both land in one dashboard."
  - question: "Is Kimi K3 open source?"
    answer: 'Yes. Moonshot published the full Kimi K3 weights on July 26, 2026, under a custom "Kimi K3 License" rather than MIT or Apache 2.0 — check the LICENSE file before commercial self-hosting. Opus 4.8 stays closed, so this is the sharpest difference between them. See [our Kimi K3 overview](/blog/kimi-k3) for the full release details.'

Kimi K3 is the first open-weight model that makes the Kimi K3 vs Claude Opus 4.8 question worth asking seriously. On the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index, K3 ranks fourth of 189 models — level with Opus 4.8 and GPT-5.5, behind only Claude Fable 5 and GPT-5.6 Sol. It also costs 40% less per token, and its weights are expected to be released by July 27.

The honest answer is not "K3 wins" or "Opus wins" — it depends on what you're optimizing for. Here are the numbers, then the verdict.

## Benchmarks: Kimi K3 vs Claude Opus 4.8

| Benchmark                              | Kimi K3       | Claude Opus 4.8 |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index | 57 (4th/189)  | statistical tie |
| GPQA Diamond                           | 93.5%         | 93.6%           |
| Terminal-Bench 2.1                     | 88.3%\*       | 74.6%\*         |
| SWE-bench Verified                     | not published | 88.6%           |
| Arena Frontend Code                    | 1st (1,679)   | ranked below    |

\*Reported on different harnesses (Opus 4.8's score uses the Terminus-2 harness), so treat the Terminal-Bench gap as directional, not exact.

Three takeaways. On graduate-level reasoning (GPQA Diamond) the models are statistically tied. On agentic terminal work, K3's published number is well ahead, with the harness caveat above. And in Arena's blind Frontend Code testing, developers ranked K3 first outright — ahead of every model, including Anthropic's.

Where Opus 4.8 keeps an edge: SWE-bench Verified at 88.6% is a published, battle-tested result K3 has no counterpart for yet, and Anthropic's models remain the default target for agent harnesses — Claude Code, MCP tooling, and most agentic scaffolds are tuned against Claude first. K3 is three days old; its ecosystem is not.

## Pricing: 40% cheaper across the board

Per-token rates through LLM Gateway (each provider's published pricing):

| Per million tokens | Kimi K3 | Claude Opus 4.8 |
| ------------------ | ------- | --------------- |
| Input              | $3.00   | $5.00           |
| Cached input       | $0.30   | $0.50           |
| Output             | $15.00  | $25.00          |

Both have a 1M-token context window. K3's output limit defaults to 131K tokens but is configurable up to the full 1M in a single response; Opus 4.8 caps output at 128K.

Concrete math: a coding-agent workload of 100M input and 20M output tokens a month runs $600 on Kimi K3 and $1,000 on Claude Opus 4.8. Same ratio at any scale — K3 is 40% cheaper on input, cached input, and output alike.

One operational difference: K3's reasoning is always on at full effort — `reasoning_effort` currently accepts only `max`, with lower-effort modes promised in later updates. That is part of why its benchmark numbers are strong, but it means K3 spends thinking tokens even on trivial requests. Opus 4.8 lets you dial reasoning effort up and down per request today — cheaper and faster on the easy 80%.

## What each one is for

**Pick Kimi K3 when** cost dominates, you want frontend-heavy code generation (the Arena result is real), you need single-shot outputs longer than 128K tokens, or open weights matter — self-hosting, fine-tuning, or simply not depending on one vendor's API terms.

**Pick Claude Opus 4.8 when** you're running mature agent harnesses tuned for Claude, you want configurable reasoning effort, or you need the SWE-bench-class repo-editing reliability that teams have already validated in production.

**Or don't pick.** The switch between them is a one-word change to the request body, which makes the real answer an A/B test on your own workload:

```bash
curl https://api.vichar.io/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "kimi-k3",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Implement the retry logic described in RFC-42.md"}]
  }'
```

Run a week on `kimi-k3`, a week on `claude-opus-4-8`, and read the answer off your LLM Gateway dashboard — per-model cost, latency, and token counts side by side.

## Flat rate or pay-as-you-go

Both models count as **premium-tier** on [DevPass](https://devpass.vichar.io) ($29/$79/$179 per month), drawing from the weekly premium allowance — so a flat-rate plan covers the A/B test without a separate Anthropic subscription. On pay-as-you-go credits you pay the per-token rates above plus a 5% platform fee at top-up, from $10.
