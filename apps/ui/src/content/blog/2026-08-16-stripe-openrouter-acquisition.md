title: "Stripe's OpenRouter Acquisition: What Changes for You"
summary: "Stripe and OpenRouter confirmed the deal on August 19, 2026, three days after Bloomberg reported it. Here's what is verified, what OpenRouter says changes for customers (nothing, for now), and how to check whether you could leave any gateway if you needed to."
categories: ["Guides"]
faqs:
  - question: "Did Stripe acquire OpenRouter?"
    answer: "Yes. Stripe and OpenRouter announced on August 19, 2026 that Stripe has agreed to acquire OpenRouter, subject to customary closing conditions, after Bloomberg reported the deal on August 16 at more than $7 billion (later reports put it at about $7.5 billion). OpenRouter says the name, product, pricing, and roadmap stay the same."
  - question: "What happens to OpenRouter now that Stripe is buying it?"
    answer: "Nobody outside the two companies knows, and no post-close plan has been published. The nearest precedent is Lemon Squeezy, which Stripe acquired in July 2024 and which still operates as a standalone product — though Stripe went on to build Stripe Managed Payments around it. The realistic short-term expectation is that the API keeps working and the pricing model gets revisited on Stripe's timeline, not yours."
  - question: "Should I migrate off OpenRouter because of the acquisition?"
    answer: "Not reflexively. An acquisition is a reason to verify that you could migrate, not proof that you should. Run the portability check in this post: confirm your calls use the plain OpenAI-compatible surface, that you own the provider keys, that you can export your request logs, and that you have a tested fallback base URL. If all four hold, you can stay and watch."
  - question: "What is the best OpenRouter alternative?"
    answer: "It depends on the constraint driving the move — fees, self-hosting, latency, or governance. We compared ten of them honestly in our [OpenRouter alternatives](/blog/openrouter-alternatives) guide, including options we don't sell. If the blocker is that OpenRouter cannot run inside your own infrastructure, the shortlist is much shorter: see [open-source OpenRouter alternatives](/blog/open-source-openrouter-alternatives)."

> **Update, September 20, 2026:** Both companies confirmed the deal on August 19, 2026 — see [Stripe's announcement](https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/stripe-agrees-to-acquire-openrouter) and [OpenRouter's post](https://openrouter.ai/blog/announcements/openrouter-is-joining-stripe/). It is subject to customary closing conditions, which OpenRouter expected to clear "in the coming weeks". OpenRouter's stated position: same name, same product, same pricing, same roadmap, and routing decisions stay neutral. The portability checklist below is unchanged and still worth running.

On August 16, 2026, [Bloomberg reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-08-16/stripe-nears-deal-to-buy-ai-firm-openrouter-for-over-7-billion) that Stripe has finalized a deal to acquire OpenRouter for more than $7 billion. The Wall Street Journal had reported talks at roughly $10 billion on July 23, 2026. Stripe [declined to comment](https://techcrunch.com/2026/08/16/stripe-will-reportedly-acquire-ai-gateway-startup-openrouter-for-7b/) on the report, and OpenRouter has not announced anything.

So the honest summary, as of publication: multiple credible outlets report the deal is done, and neither party has confirmed it.

If you route production traffic through OpenRouter, none of that changes how your integration behaves. Your keys still work. What it should change is how confident you are that you could leave — which is a different question, and one worth answering while nothing is on fire.

## What Is Actually Verified

Worth separating the reported from the confirmed, because the numbers are moving around:

OpenRouter was founded in 2023 by Alex Atallah and Louis Vichy, and raised that Series B from Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, Menlo Ventures and CapitalG. A $1.3 billion valuation in May and a reported $7 billion-plus exit in August is a roughly 5x markup in three months, which tells you how the market was pricing the routing layer in August 2026.

Atallah has described OpenRouter as "the equivalent of Stripe for AI." It is a good line, and it explains the deal better than any strategy memo: Stripe is buying the metering-and-billing layer of AI inference, not a model.

## Why This Deal Makes Sense (And Why That's the Point)

The mechanics are worth understanding, because they predict what gets optimized next.

OpenRouter charges **5.5% on credit purchases** (minimum $0.80) when you pay by card, and 5% via crypto. It applies **no markup to tokens** — provider list price passes through. Bring-your-own-keys is free up to $25,000 per month of list-price inference on pay-as-you-go, or $200,000 on enterprise, and 5% above that.

Look at where the money is in that structure. It is not in the inference. It is in the payment. And the 5.5% card path already runs on Stripe.

An acquirer that owns the payment rail can do things to that number an independent router cannot: absorb it, restructure it, bundle it into an existing merchant relationship, or route it through Stripe's own balance products. Whatever happens to the headline fee, it will be set by what is optimal for a payments business. That may well be _cheaper_ for you. It just won't be a decision you're part of.

## The Three Questions Worth Asking

Not "should I panic." These:

**1. Does a routing layer stay neutral when its owner sells adjacent products?** OpenRouter's core value is impartial routing across roughly 400 models. That impartiality has never had to survive a parent company with its own agentic-commerce ambitions. It may survive fine. It is a new variable in a product whose entire pitch was not having variables like that.

**2. What is your exposure if the pricing model is rebuilt?** Run the arithmetic on your own bill before someone else does. If you're on BYOK under your plan's free allowance — $25,000 a month of list-price inference on pay-as-you-go, $200,000 on enterprise — you are currently paying nothing and have the most to lose from a restructure. If you're buying credits, you're paying 5.5% and might benefit. Know which one you are.

**3. Who is in your vendor review now?** This is the one that actually blocks deals. If your DPA, security questionnaire, or procurement record names OpenRouter, a change of ownership is a prompt to re-check those documents rather than an automatic rewrite of them. Whether anything has to change depends on specifics you can only get from the vendor: which legal entity is the counterparty after close, whether the sub-processor list, retention terms or transfer mechanism move, and what your existing agreement says about assignment and change of control. Confirm those before updating vendor records — and note that until the deal is confirmed and closed, there may be nothing to update at all.

There is a fourth thing that is _not_ worth worrying about, and it's worth saying plainly: the API is not about to break. The nearest precedent is Lemon Squeezy, which Stripe acquired in July 2024 and which still ran as a standalone product as of publication, with Stripe Managed Payments built alongside it. Acquired infrastructure usually gets absorbed slowly.

## The Portability Check Worth Running Before You Need It

This is the part that is useful regardless of what happens to the deal, and regardless of which gateway you use — including ours.

A gateway is only a good idea if leaving it is cheap. Four things determine that:

- **Are your calls plain OpenAI-compatible?** If your requests use `/v1/chat/completions` with standard fields, any OpenAI-compatible gateway is a base-URL change. If you've adopted vendor-specific routing syntax, provider preference objects, or proprietary SDK helpers, each one is migration work. Grep for them now, not later.
- **Do you own the provider keys?** BYOK means the relationship with OpenAI, Anthropic and Google is yours. If the gateway is buying tokens on your behalf, your ability to walk depends on getting your own keys provisioned first — which takes days at enterprise scale, and longer if a provider needs to approve your volume.
- **Can you export your request logs?** Cost history, latency baselines and prompt archives are what let you prove a migration didn't regress. Export them on a schedule, not on the day you need them.
- **Have you ever tested a second base URL?** A fallback you have never exercised is a hypothesis. Exercise it in an approved test environment using synthetic prompts or redacted replay data — not a slice of live production traffic, which would send real user content to a vendor you have not papered yet. Synthetic traffic is enough to find what actually breaks: auth, model-string mapping, streaming, tool-call shapes.

If all four hold, you have leverage and can wait this out. If any fail, fix that one — the fix is worth doing even if OpenRouter stays exactly as it is.

## If You Do Want to Move

**LLM Gateway** is OpenAI-compatible on purpose, so the migration is the boring one:

```diff
- const baseURL = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1";
- const apiKey = process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY;
+ const baseURL = "https://api.vichar.io/v1";
+ const apiKey = process.env.LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY;
```

Or with curl, against the same model strings you already use:

```bash
curl https://api.vichar.io/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5",
    "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello!" }]
  }'
```

The differences that matter for this particular decision:

|                     | LLM Gateway                          | OpenRouter                                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Credits fee         | Flat 5%                              | 5.5% by card ($0.80 min), 5% crypto                                     |
| Bring your own keys | Free, pay providers directly         | Free to $25k/mo list price on pay-as-you-go ($200k enterprise), then 5% |
| Self-hosting        | Yes — AGPLv3, run it in your own VPC | No, cloud only                                                          |
| API surface         | OpenAI-compatible                    | OpenAI-compatible                                                       |
| Ownership           | Independent                          | Reportedly Stripe                                                       |

We are not going to pretend OpenRouter's BYOK terms are bad — $25,000 a month of free list-price inference on pay-as-you-go covers most teams entirely, enterprise gets $200,000, and their no-markup token policy is genuinely fair. The structural difference is the third row. There is no version of OpenRouter that runs inside your own network, at any price. If the acquisition makes your security team ask where prompts are processed, that row is the whole conversation.

Full steps, including the model-string mapping and the SDK examples, are in the [OpenRouter migration guide](/migration/openrouter). If you want the wider field before choosing, we compared ten options — several of which we don't sell — in [OpenRouter alternatives](/blog/openrouter-alternatives).

## What We'd Actually Do

If we were running inference on OpenRouter when this broke: nothing dramatic. Run the portability check. Get your own provider keys provisioned if you don't have them. Export a month of logs. Exercise a second gateway with synthetic or redacted traffic in a test environment so the fallback is real. Then watch what the fee schedule does after close.

That's the same advice we'd give about depending on us. A gateway earns the traffic every month; it shouldn't be able to keep it by making departure expensive.
