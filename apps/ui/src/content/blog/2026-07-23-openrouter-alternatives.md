title: "10 Best OpenRouter Alternatives in 2026 (Compared)"
summary: "The 10 best OpenRouter alternatives in 2026, compared honestly — open-source gateways, managed routers, and enterprise platforms — with fees, self-hosting, and routing side by side."
categories: ["Guides"]
faqs:
  - question: "What is the best OpenRouter alternative in 2026?"
    answer: "LLM Gateway is the strongest overall alternative: it's the only gateway that is open source (AGPLv3), self-hostable, and offered as a managed cloud with zero BYOK markup. Which option is best for you depends on the constraint driving the switch — fees, self-hosting, latency, or governance."
  - question: "Is there an open-source alternative to OpenRouter?"
    answer: "Yes — several. LLM Gateway (AGPLv3) is the most complete, shipping the dashboard, caching, analytics, and routing, not just a proxy. LiteLLM and Bifrost are solid open-source proxies you operate yourself. See the full [open-source OpenRouter alternatives](/blog/open-source-openrouter-alternatives) list."
  - question: "Why do developers switch away from OpenRouter?"
    answer: "Four reasons come up most: the 5.5% fee on credit purchases, the BYOK fee after the free monthly cap, the lack of any self-hosting option, and gateway latency in interactive apps. Teams with compliance requirements switch because a cloud-only gateway can't meet data-residency rules at any price."
  - question: "How hard is it to migrate from OpenRouter?"
    answer: "Usually minutes. OpenRouter and its alternatives expose OpenAI-compatible endpoints, so the change is a base URL and API key, plus model-name prefixes in some cases. The [migration guide](https://docs.vichar.io/migrations/openrouter) covers the details."

OpenRouter made multi-model access easy: one API key, roughly 400+ models across 70+ providers, nothing to deploy. For prototyping, it's hard to beat.

Then the invoice and the architecture review arrive. Every credit purchase carries a 5.5% fee. Bring-your-own-keys is free only up to a monthly cap, then costs 5%. Every request routes through a third-party cloud you can't self-host, which is a hard stop for data-residency and compliance teams. And the extra hop is measurable: in [our open-source TTFT benchmark](/blog/openrouter-vs-vercel-vs-llmgateway-performance), OpenRouter's median time to first token was roughly 50% higher on the same model.

That's why "OpenRouter alternatives" is one of the most-searched gateway queries of 2026. We compared the 10 best OpenRouter alternatives in 2026 on the things that actually differ: what the gateway costs on top of provider prices, whether you can self-host, how routing and failover work, and who each option genuinely fits. We build one of them, so we're biased — but we'll tell you where each option wins.

> **Update, August 19, 2026:** Stripe has agreed to acquire OpenRouter for a reported $7 billion-plus; both companies confirmed it on August 19, and OpenRouter says pricing, product, and roadmap stay the same. Nothing in this comparison changes today — the API, the fees and the model catalog are as described below. What changes is who sets them next. We wrote up what is verified and what to check before reacting in [Stripe's OpenRouter acquisition: what changes for you](/blog/stripe-openrouter-acquisition).

## Why Teams Look for OpenRouter Alternatives

The complaints are consistent:

- **The fees compound at scale.** A 5.5% fee on every credit purchase is invisible at $50/month and very visible at $50,000/month. BYOK doesn't fully escape it either — it's free up to a monthly cap, then 5%.
- **Cloud-only, forever.** There is no self-hosted OpenRouter. If your security team requires prompts to stay inside your boundary, the product can't comply, at any price.
- **The extra hop costs latency.** Interactive apps and agent loops feel every added millisecond before the first token.
- **Governance is thin until Enterprise.** Team management exists, but guardrails, audit depth, and spend controls arrive late and gated.

If none of that bothers you, keep OpenRouter — it's a good product with the largest catalog in the space. If it does, here are the alternatives.

## What to Look for in an OpenRouter Alternative

Four questions separate the options fast:

1. **What does it cost on top of provider prices?** In 2026 the serious gateways don't mark up tokens — the competition is platform fees and BYOK terms. Watch for the exception below that still marks up per token.
2. **Managed, self-hosted, or both?** Cloud-only is exactly what you may be leaving. Some alternatives are open source; one offers both a managed cloud and self-hosting.
3. **Is routing smart or just a fallback list?** Weighted routing on live uptime, latency, and price beats a static provider order.
4. **What happens at production scale?** Caching, request-level analytics, guardrails, and audit logs are the features you'll want in month three.

## 1. LLM Gateway

**Best overall. Open source, self-hostable, zero BYOK markup.**

[LLM Gateway](https://app.vichar.io) is the closest thing to "OpenRouter you can own." It's an open-source (AGPLv3) gateway that routes to 200+ models across 40+ providers through one OpenAI-compatible endpoint — available as a managed cloud where routing, caching, analytics, and billing are already wired together, or self-hosted with a single Docker command.

**What sets it apart:**

- **Both deployment models** — use the managed cloud and run zero infrastructure, or self-host the same AGPLv3 codebase inside your own boundary; OpenRouter offers no self-hosting at all
- **Zero markup on BYOK** — bring your own provider keys and pay nothing on top of provider costs, with no monthly cap before fees start
- **Faster first token** — in an [interleaved TTFT benchmark](/blog/openrouter-vs-vercel-vs-llmgateway-performance) on the same model, LLM Gateway reached the first token ~35% faster than OpenRouter cold and ~34% faster warm, with the raw data published
- **Smart routing, not provider lists** — providers are scored on live uptime, throughput, price, and latency; failed requests retry and fail over transparently
- **Production features included** — Redis-backed response caching with configurable TTL, per-request cost and latency analytics, and guardrails, audit logs, and team management on the Enterprise plan

Because both sides speak the OpenAI API, [migrating from OpenRouter](https://docs.vichar.io/migrations/openrouter) is a two-line change:

```typescript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: "https://api.vichar.io/v1",
  apiKey: process.env.LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY,
});
```

**Pricing:** Free to self-host. Managed cloud is pay-as-you-go with a 5% platform fee on credits — or 0% with your own provider keys.

**Best for:** Teams that liked OpenRouter's one-API model but need self-hosting, zero BYOK fees, or production-grade routing. See the full [LLM Gateway vs OpenRouter](/blog/llm-gateway-vs-openrouter) breakdown or the [feature-by-feature comparison](/compare/open-router).

## 2. Vercel AI Gateway

**Zero markup, native to the AI SDK.**

Vercel AI Gateway routes to hundreds of models across 45+ providers and has been GA since 2025. It's the default provider for the Vercel AI SDK, with both OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible endpoints.

**Strengths:**

- Zero markup on tokens, including BYOK
- First-class AI SDK integration — if you use `streamText`, it just works
- Failover, caching, and spend monitoring built in

**Weaknesses:**

- Managed only — no open source, no self-hosting, the same architectural lock-in as OpenRouter
- Tied to a Vercel team account; some governance features cost extra
- Least compelling if you're not already in the Vercel ecosystem

**Pricing:** Pay-as-you-go credits with no token markup.

**Best for:** Teams building on the Vercel AI SDK who want a managed router with better economics than OpenRouter's credit fee.

---

## 3. Requesty

**The closest like-for-like swap — with a token markup.**

Requesty is a managed LLM router in the same mold as OpenRouter: one API key, 600+ models, caching, and a free tier of 200 requests per day. It adds EU data residency, which matters to European teams OpenRouter can't serve well.

**Strengths:**

- Familiar model: sign up, get a key, route to hundreds of models
- Caching and EU data residency included on every plan
- Free tier to evaluate without a card

**Weaknesses:**

- Charges a 5% markup on provider token rates — the one pricing model most 2026 gateways have abandoned; a $10/M-token model costs $10.50/M through Requesty
- Not open source and no self-hosting
- Enterprise features (SSO, RBAC) are quote-only

**Pricing:** Pay-as-you-go with a 5% markup on base model costs.

**Best for:** Solo developers who want OpenRouter's simplicity with EU residency and accept a per-token markup for it.

---

## 4. LiteLLM

**The best-known open-source proxy, if you'll run it yourself.**

LiteLLM is an open-source Python proxy that speaks the OpenAI format to 100+ providers. It's the default answer to "OpenRouter but self-hosted" — with the operational bill that implies.

**Strengths:**

- Open source, self-hosted, huge provider coverage
- Works in-process as a Python library, not just as a proxy
- Virtual keys, budgets, and spend tracking built in

**Weaknesses:**

- You become the platform team: deploying, scaling, and patching the proxy plus its Redis and Postgres dependencies
- SSO, audit logs, and admin controls sit behind the paid enterprise tier
- Python runtime becomes the bottleneck at high request volumes

**Pricing:** Free and open source; you run it. Paid enterprise tier for governance features.

**Best for:** Python-first teams that want full control and are staffed to operate their own gateway. See our [LiteLLM alternatives](/blog/litellm-alternatives) list if the ops load is the concern.

---

## 5. Portkey

**Enterprise governance, now part of Palo Alto Networks.**

Portkey is an AI gateway aimed at enterprises: deep request tracing, guardrails, budgets, and compliance controls. Gateway 2.0 (March 2026) open-sourced most of the governance and observability stack under MIT, and Palo Alto Networks acquired Portkey in May 2026, folding it into Prisma AIRS.

**Strengths:**

- Mature observability: traces, logs, and cost attribution
- Guardrails and policy controls suited to compliance-heavy teams
- Much of the platform is now MIT-licensed

**Weaknesses:**

- Full platform still requires their cloud for log storage and compliance features
- Usage-based pricing (from $49/month plus per-log fees) adds up at volume
- Now part of a large security vendor — a plus for some buyers, a lock-in concern for others

**Pricing:** Free tier; Production from $49/month plus $9 per 100k logs; enterprise by quote.

**Best for:** Enterprises that want governance and observability first and are comfortable inside a large vendor's security portfolio.

---

## 6. Bifrost

**A fast open-source proxy you operate yourself.**

Bifrost (from Maxim AI) is a self-hosted, open-source gateway written in Go. Its pitch is raw efficiency: the project benchmarks its routing overhead in microseconds per request at thousands of requests per second.

**Strengths:**

- Open source and self-hosted — a single Go binary
- Very low routing overhead at high request volumes
- Governance features (virtual keys, budgets) in the open-source core

**Weaknesses:**

- No managed cloud — leaving OpenRouter for Bifrost means taking on the ops OpenRouter was saving you
- Younger project with a smaller community and integration ecosystem
- Observability is thinner than the platform gateways

**Pricing:** Free and open source; you run it. Paid support via Maxim.

**Best for:** Teams that want to self-host and need maximum throughput per node.

---

## 7. Cloudflare AI Gateway

**Edge caching and cost visibility for Cloudflare shops.**

Cloudflare AI Gateway proxies LLM requests through Cloudflare's edge, adding caching, rate limiting, retries, and per-request analytics with minimal setup — point your provider's base URL at it and you're done.

**Strengths:**

- Trivial setup if you're on Cloudflare; generous free tier
- Edge caching and rate limiting close to users
- Useful cost and latency analytics per provider

**Weaknesses:**

- A visibility-and-caching layer more than a routing gateway — no smart multi-provider failover
- No unified billing across providers; you still manage every provider account yourself
- Basic feature set compared to purpose-built gateways

**Pricing:** Free core features with a Cloudflare account; paid tiers for higher limits.

**Best for:** Teams already on Cloudflare who want caching and observability rather than a full OpenRouter replacement.

---

## 8. Kong AI Gateway

**LLM routing as plugins on API infrastructure you already run.**

Kong AI Gateway extends Kong's API gateway with AI plugins: multi-LLM routing, semantic caching, prompt guarding, and token-based rate limiting. If Kong already fronts your APIs, your platform team can manage LLM traffic with the tooling they know.

**Strengths:**

- One gateway layer for APIs and LLMs — same plugins, same observability, same team
- Semantic caching and prompt-security plugins
- Self-hostable open-source core plus the managed Konnect platform

**Weaknesses:**

- Heavyweight if you don't already run Kong — you'd adopt an API platform to get an LLM proxy
- LLM features are plugins on a general-purpose gateway, not a purpose-built product
- No provider billing layer; you manage provider keys and spend elsewhere

**Pricing:** Open-source gateway is free; AI features expand under paid Konnect and Enterprise tiers.

**Best for:** Platform teams already standardized on Kong who want LLM traffic under the same roof.

---

## 9. Eden AI

**One API for AI beyond LLMs.**

Eden AI aggregates far more than chat models: 500+ models and APIs spanning text, OCR, document parsing, speech, translation, and image analysis. It's less an OpenRouter replacement than a different product that overlaps on LLM routing.

**Strengths:**

- Single API for LLMs plus OCR, speech, translation, and vision tasks
- Provider switching across the non-LLM AI landscape, which few gateways touch
- Free plan to evaluate

**Weaknesses:**

- LLM routing depth (failover, smart routing, caching control) trails the purpose-built gateways
- Not open source and no self-hosting
- Overkill if all you need is chat-model routing

**Pricing:** Pay-as-you-go on top of provider pricing; free credits to start.

**Best for:** Product teams that need OCR, speech, or translation behind the same key as their LLM calls.

---

## 10. TrueFoundry

**Kubernetes-native gateway inside your own VPC.**

TrueFoundry ships an AI gateway as part of its broader ML platform, deployed Kubernetes-native in your own cloud account with RBAC, budgets, and governance. It advertises low single-digit-millisecond overhead at hundreds of requests per second per vCPU.

**Strengths:**

- Runs entirely in your VPC — data never leaves your boundary
- Enterprise governance: RBAC, quotas, audit, cost controls
- Part of a full ML platform if you also need training and deployment tooling

**Weaknesses:**

- Not open source, and buying it means an enterprise sales motion
- Overkill if you only need a gateway rather than an ML platform
- You still operate the Kubernetes footprint it runs on

**Pricing:** Enterprise; by quote.

**Best for:** Enterprises with strict data-residency requirements and an existing Kubernetes practice.

---

## Two Names You Can Skip in 2026

Older "OpenRouter alternatives" lists still recommend two products you should no longer adopt:

- **Helicone** was acquired by Mintlify in March 2026 and is in maintenance mode. Fine if you already run it; the wrong choice for a new deployment — see the [best Helicone alternatives](/blog/helicone-alternatives).
- **Unify** shut down its LLM router and pivoted to AI agents. It's no longer a gateway.

If a comparison article lists either as an active gateway, check its publish date.

## How to Choose

**You want OpenRouter's one-API model without the fees or the lock-in:** [LLM Gateway](https://app.vichar.io) is the only option that's open source, self-hostable, _and_ offered as a managed cloud with zero BYOK markup.

**You're already deep in the Vercel AI SDK:** Vercel AI Gateway is the shortest path.

**You want the most familiar managed swap and are in the EU:** Requesty — just price in the 5% token markup.

**You need to self-host:** LLM Gateway for a full platform, LiteLLM or Bifrost for a bare proxy you operate.

**You're buying for a compliance team:** Portkey or TrueFoundry, depending on whether you want a managed platform or your own VPC.

**You already run Kong or Cloudflare:** Their AI gateways add caching and controls with the least new vendor surface — just know their routing is thinner.

Whatever you pick, check the fee structure before you commit — see our breakdown of [who marks up your tokens](/blog/ai-gateway-fees-compared) and the wider [best AI gateways](/blog/best-ai-gateways) comparison. If self-hosting is the requirement, we've ranked the [open-source OpenRouter alternatives](/blog/open-source-openrouter-alternatives) separately, and there's a dedicated list of [OpenRouter alternatives for enterprise teams](/blog/openrouter-alternatives-for-enterprise).

## Migrating Off OpenRouter

Every gateway on this list speaks the OpenAI API, so the mechanical migration is small — a base URL and API key change, plus occasionally a model-prefix rename:

```diff
- const baseURL = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1";
- const apiKey = process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY;
+ const baseURL = "https://api.vichar.io/v1";
+ const apiKey = process.env.LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY;
```

The real work is recreating provider preferences, spend limits, and app attribution in the new gateway. The [OpenRouter migration guide](https://docs.vichar.io/migrations/openrouter) maps each piece, including model-name differences and the AI SDK provider swap.
