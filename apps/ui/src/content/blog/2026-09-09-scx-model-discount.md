Use the promotion to compare models on your own prompts or run an existing workflow at a lower cost. Browse the [SCX provider page](/providers/scx-ai-gp) for current availability and rates.

## Route your requests through SCX

With a pay-as-you-go LLM Gateway API key, choose SCX by adding `scx-ai-gp/` before the model ID. Your endpoint and API key stay the same:

```bash
curl https://api.vichar.io/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "scx-ai-gp/glm-5.3",
    "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Review this function for edge cases." }]
  }'
```

The offer applies to eligible usage **served by SCX during the promotion**. If a request falls back to another provider, that provider's rates apply. To require SCX without fallback, add the `X-No-Fallback: true` header. See the [routing guide](https://docs.vichar.io/features/routing#provider-specific-routing) for details.
