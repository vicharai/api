title: "Claude Opus 4.8 Pricing and the Hidden Tokenizer Tax"
summary: "Claude Opus 4.8 lists at $5/$25 per million tokens — the same as Opus 4.6. But Anthropic's newer tokenizer can turn the same text into up to ~35% more tokens, so your real bill can climb even when the sticker price doesn't."
categories: ["Guides"]
model: claude-opus-4-8
faqs:
  - question: "Did Claude Opus 4.8 get more expensive than Opus 4.6?"
    answer: "The per-token price is the same — $5 input / $25 output per million. But the newer tokenizer (Opus 4.7+) can turn the same text into up to ~35% more tokens, so your real cost per request can be higher even though the rate didn't change."
  - question: "How do I know how many tokens my requests actually use?"
    answer: "Measure them. LLM Gateway logs exact input and output token counts and the real cost for every request, so you can see actual consumption per model instead of estimating from the list price."
  - question: "Why does the same text cost different amounts on different models?"
    answer: "Because each model's tokenizer splits text differently. A more granular tokenizer produces more tokens for the same words, raising cost even at a lower per-token rate. Always compare models on total cost for your real workload, not on the headline price."

Look at Anthropic's pricing page and Claude Opus has barely moved: Opus 4.6, 4.7, and 4.8 all list at **$5 per million input tokens and $25 per million output**. Reassuring — until your invoice goes up after a model upgrade you expected to be cost-neutral. The culprit isn't the per-token rate. It's the **tokenizer**: how the model chops your text into billable tokens. This is the hidden tax that LLM cost comparisons almost always miss, and **LLM Gateway** makes it visible per request.

## The sticker price is flat. The real bill isn't.

Per-token pricing only tells you half the story. Your actual cost is:

> tokens consumed × price per token

Vendors quote the price per token. They don't quote how many tokens your text becomes — and that number depends entirely on the tokenizer. Anthropic's newer Opus models (4.7 and up) use an updated tokenizer that can encode the same English text into **up to ~35% more tokens** than earlier versions. Same prompt, same response, same $5/$25 rate — more tokens, bigger bill.

## A worked example

Say a typical request is 1,000 input tokens and 500 output tokens under the old tokenizer. At $5/$25 that's:

- Input: 1,000 × $5 / 1M = $0.005
- Output: 500 × $25 / 1M = $0.0125
- **Total: $0.0175 per request**

Now run the identical text through a tokenizer that produces ~35% more tokens — 1,350 in, 675 out:

- Input: 1,350 × $5 / 1M = $0.00675
- Output: 675 × $25 / 1M = $0.016875
- **Total: ~$0.0236 per request — about 35% more**

Across 100,000 requests a day, that's the difference between roughly $1,750 and $2,360 daily — about **$18,000 more per month** for the same work, with no change to the advertised price.

## Why tokenizers differ

A tokenizer maps text to integers from a fixed vocabulary. A vocabulary tuned for code, multilingual text, or specific formatting will split the same string differently than an older one. "Cheaper per token" can still mean "more expensive per sentence" if the newer tokenizer is more granular. This is also why you can't compare two models on per-token price alone — a $3/1M model that needs 20% more tokens can cost more than a $3.50/1M model that's more efficient.

## See your real token usage

The only way to manage this is to measure tokens consumed, not tokens quoted. Every request through LLM Gateway logs the exact input and output token counts and the real cost, per model and per provider, in the dashboard. When you upgrade a model, you can compare the actual token consumption for the same workload side by side — not the list price, the real spend.

To estimate before you switch, drop your real prompt and expected volume into the [Token Cost Calculator](/token-cost-calculator) and compare models on total cost, not headline rate.

## How to keep the bill down

- **Cache repeat requests.** Cached responses cost nothing, no matter how the tokenizer counts. For FAQ bots, classification, and CI runs, response caching erases a large share of token spend.
- **Route by difficulty.** Send simple requests to cheaper, token-efficient models and reserve Opus for the work that needs it. A gateway with automatic routing does this for you.
- **Compare on total cost.** Use real token counts from your own logs when you evaluate a model change, so a "free" upgrade doesn't quietly raise your run rate.

## Measure tokens, not list prices

A flat per-token rate can hide a real increase in what you pay. The fix is visibility: see the actual tokens and cost behind every request, compare models on total spend, and cache or route to cut the tokens you send. LLM Gateway gives you all three behind one OpenAI-compatible API.
