Two weeks is a short window to move a workload onto a new provider. The **SCX model discount** was scheduled to end on **September 24, 2026**. We are extending it by 15 days: **20% off seven selected models** through **LLM Gateway** now runs until **October 9, 2026 at 23:59:59 UTC**.

Everything else stays the same. Same discount, same seven models, same way to route requests.

## What the SCX model discount extension covers

The offer still covers these seven SCX deployments. Each link opens the model's live pricing and API details.

- [GLM 5.3](/models/glm-5.3/scx-ai-gp)
- [GLM 5.3 Flash](/models/glm-5.3-flash/scx-ai-gp)
- [GLM 5.2](/models/glm-5.2/scx-ai-gp)
- [GLM 5.2 Turbo](/models/glm-5.2-fast/scx-ai-gp)
- [Qwen 3.8 Max](/models/qwen3.8-max/scx-ai-gp)
- [Kimi K2.7 Code](/models/kimi-k2.7-code/scx-ai-gp)
- [Kimi K3](/models/kimi-k3/scx-ai-gp)

The discounted price shows on each model page while the promotion runs. If you are already sending traffic to SCX, you keep the discount without changing anything. If you started an evaluation this month, the extension gives you a full 30 days at the reduced rate. Browse the [SCX provider page](/providers/scx-ai-gp) for current availability and rates.

## Route your requests through SCX

With a pay-as-you-go LLM Gateway API key, choose SCX by adding `scx-ai-gp/` before the model ID. Your endpoint and API key stay the same:

```bash
curl https://api.vichar.io/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "scx-ai-gp/kimi-k3",
    "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Summarize the open issues in this repository." }]
  }'
```

The discount applies to eligible usage **served by SCX during the promotion**. If a request falls back to another provider, that provider's rates apply. To require SCX without fallback, add the `X-No-Fallback: true` header. See the [routing guide](https://docs.vichar.io/features/routing#provider-specific-routing) for details.

## Make the most of the extra 15 days

- **[Create your LLM Gateway account](https://app.vichar.io/signup)** and get an API key.
- **[Pick an SCX model](/providers/scx-ai-gp)** and pin it with the `scx-ai-gp/` prefix.
- **[Read the original announcement](/blog/scx-model-discount)** for the full terms of the offer.
