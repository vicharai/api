## Dev Plans: AI-Powered Development Planning (Beta)

We're launching **Dev Plans** — a new way to plan and execute software projects with AI assistance. Break down complex features into actionable steps, get implementation guidance, and ship faster.

**[Try Dev Plans now](https://devpass.vichar.io)** — we're looking for early feedback to shape the product.

### What you can do

- **Plan features** — describe what you want to build and get a structured implementation plan
- **Break down tasks** — complex projects split into manageable, actionable steps
- **Get code guidance** — AI-assisted implementation recommendations

Dev Plans is available on all paid plans. We'd love your feedback as we iterate on this feature.

## Native Web Search

LLM responses can now include **real-time web data**. No more outdated information — your AI assistant can search the web to answer questions about current events, recent releases, or live data.

### How it works

Web search is billed per search call and works seamlessly with supported models. **[Read the docs](https://docs.vichar.io/features/web-search)**

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.vichar.io/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the latest AI announcements this week?"}],
    "web_search": true
  }'
```

## MiniMax Provider

We've added **MiniMax** as a new provider, expanding your options for high-quality language models. MiniMax offers competitive pricing and strong performance across various tasks.

## Structured Outputs for Anthropic & Perplexity

Get reliable JSON responses with **structured outputs** — now available for Anthropic Claude models and Perplexity. Define your schema and get guaranteed valid JSON back.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.vichar.io/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Extract the name and email from: John Smith, john@example.com"}],
    "response_format": {
      "type": "json_schema",
      "json_schema": {
        "name": "contact",
        "schema": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "name": {"type": "string"},
            "email": {"type": "string"}
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

- **Clickable model IDs** — copy model identifiers with one click
- **Web search pricing** — see which models support web search and at what cost
- **Coding models filter** — quickly find models optimized for code generation
