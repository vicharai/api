summary: "DevPass no longer has to stop at 100%: opt into pay-as-you-go overflow and, once your monthly allowance is used, requests keep flowing from a credits balance billed at provider rates. Top up from the dashboard with your saved card, set auto-reload so the balance refills itself, and track it all on the new Usage page."

Until today, hitting 100% of your DevPass monthly allowance meant a hard stop: every request was rejected until renewal, and the only ways forward were upgrading a tier or leaving for the pay-as-you-go product on app.vichar.io. That is the worst possible moment to be interrupted — usually mid-session, inside a coding agent. Now DevPass supports **pay-as-you-go overflow**: an opt-in that keeps requests flowing past the allowance by billing them from a credits balance, with the same API key and the same agents.

## Off By Default, On When You Say So

Overflow is strictly opt-in. Until you enable it, your plan works exactly as before — the monthly allowance is a hard cap, and nothing ever charges past your subscription price.

| Behavior                                | Overflow off (default)       | Overflow on                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Within monthly allowance                | Plan credits, as today       | Plan credits, as today                        |
| Monthly allowance exhausted             | Requests rejected with `402` | Requests bill your credits balance            |
| Weekly premium cap, mid-cycle           | Reset Pass or wait           | Reset Pass or wait — unchanged                |
| Weekly premium cap, allowance exhausted | Requests rejected with `402` | Premium models bill your credits balance      |
| Credits balance empty                   | —                            | Requests rejected with `402` until you top up |

Two details worth knowing:

- **Usage is billed at provider rates with no markup on tokens** — the same metering as your plan allowance. A 5% platform fee applies when you buy credits (plus 1.5% for international cards).
- **Reset Passes keep their job.** Mid-cycle, the weekly premium fair-use cap still applies even with overflow on — a Reset Pass remains the way to more premium usage inside your plan. Overflow takes over only once the monthly pool itself is gone.

## Top Up And Auto-Reload From The Dashboard

Enable overflow on the new Usage page, then top up ($10–$5,000) with the card already backing your DevPass subscription — no checkout redirect. Turn on **auto-reload** and the balance refills itself: when it falls below your threshold, we charge your reload amount to the saved card. Disabling overflow always disables auto-reload with it, so you can never buy credits you cannot spend.

Every top-up is idempotent end to end — a double-click or a retried request reuses the same charge instead of creating a second one.

## A Dedicated Usage Page

The dashboard is now split in two: **Overview** keeps your coding activity, a compact allowance snapshot, your API key, and quick-start guides; the new **Usage** page carries the full meters, the weekly premium allowance, Reset Passes, the model usage chart, and the pay-as-you-go controls.

## Also New: GitHub Copilot Is A First-Class Agent

GitHub Copilot's BYOK mode (VS Code's "OpenAI Compatible" provider and the Copilot CLI) sends no source header — it identifies only through its User-Agent, which our detection previously missed. The gateway now recognizes real Copilot traffic automatically, so it shows up in your agents dashboard, on the public leaderboard, and as a carrier in your passport, with no configuration needed.

Available on **every DevPass tier** — Lite, Pro, and Max.
