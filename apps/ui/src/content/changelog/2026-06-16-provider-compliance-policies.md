Regulated teams often can only send prompts to providers that meet a specific bar — say, a SOC 2 Type 2 certification and a guarantee that prompts are never used for training. **Provider Compliance Policies** turn that requirement into an enforced guardrail: pick the certifications and data policies you require, and the gateway refuses to route to any provider that doesn't meet them.

## How it works

Under **Settings → Compliance**, enable a policy and toggle the requirements you need:

- **SOC 2 (Type 2)**
- **ISO 27001**
- **SOC 2 or ISO 27001** (either is acceptable)
- **GDPR compliant**
- **No training on prompts**
- **No prompt logging**

Every requirement is **fail-closed** — a provider is only allowed if its published data policy explicitly satisfies it. The settings page shows a live preview of exactly which providers would be allowed and which would be blocked under the current policy.

## Enforcement at the gateway

When a request would be routed to a provider that doesn't meet the policy, the gateway blocks it with a `403` before any data is sent upstream — whether the provider was pinned (e.g. `deepseek/deepseek-v3.2`) or selected by automatic routing:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "This request was blocked by your organization's provider compliance policy. No available provider for deepseek-v3.2 meets the required certifications. Contact your LLMGateway admin to adjust the policy."
  }
}
```

Each block is recorded as a **security event**, so admins can see what was rejected and why.

## Availability

Provider compliance policies are available on the **Enterprise plan** for organization owners and admins.
