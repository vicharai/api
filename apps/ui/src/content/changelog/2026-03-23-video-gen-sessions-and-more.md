## Video Generation

LLM Gateway now supports **video generation** via the API. Generate videos from text prompts using supported models, with job-based async processing and status tracking.

- Submit a video generation request and receive a job ID
- Poll for job status — completed jobs return the video URL
- Failed jobs are properly marked with error details

**[Read the video generation docs](https://docs.vichar.io/features/video-generation)**

## Agents (formerly Sessions)

**Agents** let you track and organize conversations across multiple requests:

- Group related requests by coding agent
- Filter activity logs by agent
- View streaming cost breakdowns per agent
- Improved empty state UI when no agents exist
