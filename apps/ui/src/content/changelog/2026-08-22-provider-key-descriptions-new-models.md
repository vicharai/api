If your organization brings its own provider keys, you probably hold more than one per provider — a production and a staging account, separate billing, a key per team. Until now the dashboard told them apart by masked token alone. **Provider key descriptions** fix that: name a key when you add it (or edit the name later), and the label follows the key through the provider keys list and into each request's routing and error details — so when a request fails, you see which credential it used, not just `sk-...abcd`.

## Master Keys: Creator and Project by Name

Master key responses got the same treatment. `GET /v1/master/keys` and single-key reads now return `createdByEmail` and `projectName` alongside the existing IDs:

```json
{
  "id": "ak_...",
  "description": "Customer ACME — production key",
  "projectId": "proj_...",
  "projectName": "Customer ACME",
  "createdBy": "usr_...",
  "createdByEmail": "member@example.com"
}
```

One call renders a complete key list in your own product — no per-ID lookups to show who created a key or where it lives.

## Grok 4.6 on Bedrock and Vertex

xAI's Grok 4.6 — 500K context — now also routes through **AWS Bedrock** ($2.00/M input, $6.00/M output, $0.50/M cached input) and **Vertex AI**'s global endpoint. Both mappings were verified live across the full capability matrix: vision, tools, JSON schema output, and reasoning effort control — `low` through `xhigh` on Bedrock, `minimal` through `high` on Vertex. Same model string, two more deployments for smart routing and automatic fallback to land on.

## GLM-5.2 Turbo and an Australian Region

**GLM-5.2 Turbo** joins the catalogue on [SCX.ai](https://app.vichar.io/providers/scx-ai)'s fast deployment: a 1M-token context window at $1.99/M input and $6.16/M output, with streaming, reasoning, tool use, and JSON output. The standard GLM-5.2 mapping on SCX.ai also gains an `au` region, so Australian workloads can pin inference in-country.

Current pricing and capabilities for everything above live on the [models page](https://app.vichar.io/models).
