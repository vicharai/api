**Guardrails** protect your organization by automatically detecting and blocking harmful content in LLM requests.

## Built-in Protection

System rules detect common threats:

- **Prompt Injection** — attempts to override system instructions
- **Jailbreak** — attempts to bypass safety measures
- **PII Detection** — personal information like emails, phone numbers, SSNs
- **Secrets** — API keys, passwords, and credentials
- **Sensitive File Types** — block uploads of restricted file types

## Configurable Actions

For each rule, choose how to respond:

- **Block** — reject the request entirely
- **Redact** — remove sensitive content and continue
- **Warn** — log the violation but allow the request

## Custom Rules

Create organization-specific rules:

- **Blocked Terms** — prevent specific words or phrases
- **Custom Regex** — match patterns unique to your use case
- **Topic Restrictions** — block certain topics

## Security Events Dashboard

Monitor all violations with a dedicated dashboard showing:

- Total violations and trends
- Breakdown by action taken (blocked, redacted, warned)
- Detailed violation logs with timestamps

## Access

Guardrails are available on the **Enterprise plan**.
