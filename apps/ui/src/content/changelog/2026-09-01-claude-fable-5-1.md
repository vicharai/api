summary: "Anthropic's Claude Fable 5.1 is live on the gateway with a 1M context window, always-on adaptive thinking, stronger long-horizon agentic work, and cache reads at a quarter of Fable 5's price."

Long agentic sessions re-read the same prefix hundreds of times, and on a $10-per-million model those cache reads add up faster than the output does. **Claude Fable 5.1** extends Claude Fable 5 at the same input and output prices, but cache reads now cost **$0.25 per 1M tokens** — a quarter of Fable 5's rate — and the model brings stronger long-running agentic coding, multistep research, and document, spreadsheet, and slide work.

## Claude Fable 5.1

```bash
anthropic/claude-fable-5-1
```

| Spec           | Value                                                                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Context        | 1,000,000 tokens                                                       |
| Max output     | 128K tokens                                                            |
| Input / output | $10 / $50 per 1M tokens                                                |
| Cache read     | $0.25 per 1M tokens                                                    |
| Cache write    | $12.50 (5-minute) / $20 (1-hour) per 1M tokens                         |
| Thinking       | Adaptive, always on — steer it with `reasoning_effort`, `low` to `max` |
| Modalities     | Text and images in, text out; tool use and JSON schema output          |

Before you switch a pinned `claude-fable-5` workload over, note what carries across and what changed:

- Thinking cannot be turned off and the raw chain of thought is never returned. `reasoning_effort` (default `high`) is the only lever.
- The model accepts `max_tokens` and effort only. The gateway strips sampling parameters such as `temperature` and `top_p` before forwarding, so a request that sets them still succeeds.
- **New in 5.1:** Anthropic rejects forced tool use — `tool_choice: "required"` or a named function — with a `400`. The gateway forwards these requests with `auto` instead, so existing code keeps working; use `response_format` with a JSON schema when you need schema-valid output.
- Anthropic requires 30-day data retention for this model. A provider key from a zero-data-retention Anthropic organization is rejected upstream.

```bash
curl https://api.vichar.io/v1/chat/completions \
	-H "Authorization: Bearer $LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY" \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-d '{
		"model": "anthropic/claude-fable-5-1",
		"reasoning_effort": "xhigh",
		"messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Plan the migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL." }]
	}'
```

The model routes through Anthropic directly for now. Bedrock and Microsoft Foundry mappings follow once we have verified them end to end, and Claude Mythos 5.1 — the same model, offered by Anthropic to Project Glasswing participants by invitation only — is not listed until the gateway is enrolled.
