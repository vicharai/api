The model catalog just got a lot deeper. Anthropic's new flagship is live, two Claude models now run on a million-token context, and four more models from across the ecosystem are one API call away.

## Claude Opus 4.8

Anthropic's most capable model is available now — with a **1M token context window** out of the box.

```bash
anthropic/claude-opus-4-8
```

- **1,000,000** token context, up to **128K** output tokens
- Adaptive reasoning, vision, tool use, structured JSON output, and web search
- **$5 / 1M** input · **$25 / 1M** output

## Sonnet 4.6 Now Runs on 1M Context

`anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` now supports the full **1M token context window** — feed it entire codebases, long transcripts, or large document sets without chunking.

```bash

Every model above works through the same API key, the same OpenAI-compatible endpoint, and shows up in your usage and cost dashboards automatically. Switch between them by changing one string.
