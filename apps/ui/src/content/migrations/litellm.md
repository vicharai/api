title: Migrate from LiteLLM
description: Switch from self-hosted LiteLLM to managed LLM Gateway. Same API format, zero infrastructure to maintain.

Running your own LiteLLM proxy works—until it doesn't. Scaling, monitoring, and keeping it running becomes another job. LLM Gateway gives you the same unified API with built-in analytics, caching, and a dashboard—without the infrastructure overhead.

## Quick Migration

Both services use OpenAI-compatible endpoints, so migration is a two-line change:

```diff
- const baseURL = "http://localhost:4000/v1";  // LiteLLM proxy
+ const baseURL = "https://api.vichar.io/v1";

- const apiKey = process.env.LITELLM_API_KEY;
+ const apiKey = process.env.LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY;
```

## Why Teams Switch to LLM Gateway

| What You Get             | LiteLLM (Self-Hosted) | LLM Gateway          |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| OpenAI-compatible API    | Yes                   | Yes                  |
| Infrastructure to manage | Yes (you run it)      | No (we run it)       |
| Managed cloud option     | No                    | Yes                  |
| Analytics dashboard      | Basic                 | Per-request detail   |
| Response caching         | Manual setup          | Built-in, automatic  |
| Cost tracking            | Via callbacks         | Native, real-time    |
| Provider key management  | Config file           | Web UI with rotation |
| Uptime & scaling         | You handle it         | 99.9% SLA (managed)  |

Self-hosting also means you own the patch cycle. On March 24, 2026 two malicious `litellm` releases (1.82.7 and 1.82.8) reached PyPI and were pulled after about 40 minutes; they harvested credentials from unpinned pip installs, while pinned Docker deployments were unaffected. Pin versions wherever you self-host — LLM Gateway included — or use the managed gateway and skip the upkeep.

Still want to self-host? LLM Gateway is [open source under AGPLv3](/blog/how-to-self-host-llm-gateway)—same features, your infrastructure.

## Migration Steps

### 1. Get Your LLM Gateway API Key

Sign up at [app.vichar.io/signup](/signup) and create an API key from your dashboard.

### 2. Map Your Models

LLM Gateway supports two model ID formats:

**Canonical Model IDs** (without provider prefix) - Uses smart routing to automatically select the best provider based on uptime, throughput, price, and latency:

```
gpt-6-astra
claude-sonnet-5
gemini-3.1-pro-preview
```

**Provider-Prefixed Model IDs** - Routes to a specific provider with automatic failover if uptime drops below 90%:

```
openai/gpt-6-astra
anthropic/claude-sonnet-5
google-ai-studio/gemini-3.1-pro-preview
```

This means many LiteLLM model names work directly with LLM Gateway:

| LiteLLM Model                     | LLM Gateway Model                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| gpt-6-astra                       | gpt-6-astra or openai/gpt-6-astra                                 |
| anthropic/claude-sonnet-5         | claude-sonnet-5 or anthropic/claude-sonnet-5                      |
| gemini/gemini-3.1-pro-preview     | gemini-3.1-pro-preview or google-ai-studio/gemini-3.1-pro-preview |
| bedrock/anthropic.claude-sonnet-5 | claude-sonnet-5 or aws-bedrock/claude-sonnet-5                    |

For more details on routing behavior, see the [routing documentation](https://docs.vichar.io/features/routing).

### 3. Update Your Code

#### Python with OpenAI SDK

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Before (LiteLLM proxy)
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:4000/v1",
    api_key=os.environ["LITELLM_API_KEY"]
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-6-astra",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)

# After (LLM Gateway) - model name can stay the same!
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.vichar.io/v1",
    api_key=os.environ["LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY"]
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-6-astra",  # or "openai/gpt-6-astra" to target a specific provider
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)
```

#### Python with LiteLLM Library

If you're using the LiteLLM library directly, you can point it to LLM Gateway:

```python
import litellm

# Before (direct LiteLLM)
response = litellm.completion(
    model="gpt-6-astra",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)

# After (via LLM Gateway) - same model name works
response = litellm.completion(
    model="gpt-6-astra",  # or "openai/gpt-6-astra" to target a specific provider
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
    api_base="https://api.vichar.io/v1",
    api_key=os.environ["LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY"]
)
```

#### TypeScript/JavaScript

```typescript
import OpenAI from "openai";

// Before (LiteLLM proxy)
const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: "http://localhost:4000/v1",
  apiKey: process.env.LITELLM_API_KEY,
});

// After (LLM Gateway) - same model name works
const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: "https://api.vichar.io/v1",
  apiKey: process.env.LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY,
});

const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-6-astra", // or "openai/gpt-6-astra" to target a specific provider
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }],
});
```

#### cURL

```bash
# Before (LiteLLM proxy)
curl http://localhost:4000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LITELLM_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-6-astra",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'

# After (LLM Gateway) - same model name works
curl https://api.vichar.io/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-6-astra",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
# Use "openai/gpt-6-astra" to target a specific provider
```

### 4. Migrate Configuration

#### LiteLLM Config (Before)

```yaml
# litellm_config.yaml
model_list:
  - model_name: gpt-6-astra
    litellm_params:
      model: openai/gpt-6-astra
      api_key: sk-...
  - model_name: claude-sonnet-5
    litellm_params:
      model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-5
      api_key: sk-ant-...
```

#### LLM Gateway (After)

With LLM Gateway, you don't need a config file. Provider keys are managed in the web dashboard, or you can use the default LLM Gateway keys.

If you want to use your own provider keys, configure them in the dashboard under Settings > Provider Keys.

## Streaming Support

LLM Gateway supports streaming identically to LiteLLM:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.vichar.io/v1",
    api_key=os.environ["LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY"]
)

stream = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="openai/gpt-6-astra",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Write a story"}],
    stream=True
)

for chunk in stream:
    if chunk.choices[0].delta.content:
        print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content, end="")
```

## Function/Tool Calling

LLM Gateway supports function calling:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.vichar.io/v1",
    api_key=os.environ["LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY"]
)

tools = [{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get the weather for a location",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "location": {"type": "string"}
            },
            "required": ["location"]
        }
    }
}]

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="openai/gpt-6-astra",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in Tokyo?"}],
    tools=tools
)
```

## Removing LiteLLM Infrastructure

After verifying LLM Gateway works for your use case, you can decommission your LiteLLM proxy:

1. Update all clients to use LLM Gateway endpoints
2. Monitor the LLM Gateway dashboard for successful requests
3. Shut down your LiteLLM proxy server
4. Remove LiteLLM configuration files

## What Changes After Migration

- **No servers to babysit** — We handle scaling, uptime, and updates
- **Real-time cost visibility** — See what every request costs, broken down by model
- **Automatic caching** — Repeated requests hit cache, reducing your spend
- **Web-based management** — No more editing YAML files for config changes
- **New models immediately** — Access new releases within 48 hours, no deployment needed

## Self-Hosting LLM Gateway

If you prefer self-hosting like LiteLLM, LLM Gateway is available under AGPLv3:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vicharai/api
cd llmgateway
pnpm install
pnpm run setup
pnpm dev
```

This gives you the same benefits as LiteLLM's self-hosted proxy with LLM Gateway's analytics and caching features.
