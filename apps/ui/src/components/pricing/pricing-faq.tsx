		answer: `You pay per-token at each provider's own rates. The only platform fee is a flat ${MARKETING_STATS.platformFee} when you buy credits — no seats, no minimums, no subscription. You can start free without a credit card.`,
	},
	{
		question: "Is there a fee when I bring my own API keys?",
		answer: `No platform fee. With your own provider keys (BYOK), routing through LLM Gateway is free — you pay your providers directly and still get unified analytics, caching, and failover. The only optional charge is storage: if you enable full data retention, stored requests are billed at ${MARKETING_STATS.dataStoragePrice}.`,

			{
				href: "https://docs.vichar.io/features/data-retention#storage-pricing",
				label: "See storage pricing",
			},
		],

	{
		question: "How much do tokens cost for each model?",
		answer:
			"Every model's input and output price per million tokens is listed in the models directory, alongside context size and capabilities. The token cost calculator turns those rates into a monthly estimate for your actual traffic.",
		links: [
			{ href: "/models", label: "Browse model pricing" },
			{ href: "/token-cost-calculator", label: "Token cost calculator" },
		],
	},
	{
		question: "Do you offer volume discounts?",
		answer:
			"Yes. Enterprise plans include volume discounts on credits along with custom routing and negotiated terms — talk to us about your expected volume for a quote.",
		links: [{ href: "/enterprise", label: "Learn about Enterprise" }],
	},
	{
		question: "What does the Enterprise plan include?",
		answer: `Enterprise adds volume discounts, custom routing, unlimited data retention, and a ${MARKETING_STATS.uptimeSla} uptime SLA on top of everything in the free plan.`,
		links: [{ href: "/enterprise", label: "Explore Enterprise" }],
	},
	{
		question: "Can I get a refund?",
		answer: `Yes — refunds are self-serve. If you've used less than ${SELF_REFUND_USAGE_PERCENT}% of a credit purchase, open Billing in your dashboard and hit Refund on the charge within ${SELF_REFUND_WINDOW_DAYS} days of buying: the money goes back to your card, no support ticket needed.`,
	},
	{
		question: "Can I self-host LLM Gateway?",
		answer:
			"Yes. LLM Gateway is open source under AGPLv3, so you can self-host the gateway for free — or use the hosted platform and pay only the credit fee.",
		links: [{ href: "/open-source", label: "See the open-source project" }],
