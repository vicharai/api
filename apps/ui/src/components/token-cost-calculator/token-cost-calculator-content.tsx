							Understanding LLM token costs

							<p>
								Every large language model bills by the token, the small chunks
								of text a model reads and writes. Roughly speaking, one token is
								about four characters of English, so 1,000 tokens is around 750
								words — but the only accurate way to know is to tokenize the
								exact text. This calculator does that in your browser with a
								real BPE tokenizer, so the token counts match how the model
								actually bills you instead of a rough character estimate.
								Providers quote prices per million tokens, and they charge
								separately for the tokens you send (input) and the tokens the
								model generates (output).
							</p>
							<p>
								Output tokens are usually two to four times more expensive than
								input tokens, so the ratio between your prompt size and response
								size has a big impact on your bill. A summarization workload
								that reads a lot and writes a little costs very differently from
								a code-generation workload that writes long responses. The
								calculator above keeps the two separate so your estimate
								reflects how you actually use each model.
							</p>
							<p>
								Prices also vary by provider. A single popular model is often
								hosted by several providers at different rates, and those rates
								change as providers compete on price. Instead of locking
								yourself into one provider, Vichar routes each request to the
								cheapest available provider for that model through one
								OpenAI-compatible API, with no platform markup. That is the gap
								the calculator shows: the official list price versus the lowest
								live price you would actually pay.
							</p>
							<p>
								Use it to budget a new feature, compare GPT-4o against Claude or
								Gemini before you commit, or build the business case for
								switching providers. When the numbers look good, you can{" "}
