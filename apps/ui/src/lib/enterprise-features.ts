			'Per-project analytics answers "where did this project\'s spend go?" — Organization Analytics does the rollup for the whole org. One page totals cost, requests, and tokens across every project for any date range, and a single group-by control pivots the cost-over-time and ranking charts by canonical model, project, or API key. Enterprise organizations also get usage broken down by person: a per-member table sorted by spend, and a detail view per member with summary cards, their top model, provider, and app, and cost-by-model breakdowns. Usage is attributed by who created each API key, every chart respects the shared date-range picker, and daily buckets follow your own timezone rather than UTC midnight. It all reads from the same pre-aggregated hourly rollups the rest of the dashboard uses — no scans over raw request logs — so it stays fast on windows up to a year.',

Use it as an internal AI workbench for non-technical staff, a customer-facing AI feature, or a productized AI offering — without writing the chat UI from scratch.",
