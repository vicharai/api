		question: "Is LLM Gateway a good AWS Bedrock alternative?",
		answer:
			"Yes — if you want frontier models without committing to one cloud. LLM Gateway puts 200+ models from 40+ providers behind a single OpenAI-compatible API, with automatic routing, failover, caching, and per-request cost analytics. It's fully open source (AGPLv3) and self-hostable, so nothing ties you to a hyperscaler.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can I keep using AWS Bedrock with LLM Gateway?",
		answer:
			"Yes. AWS Bedrock is a built-in LLM Gateway provider. Bring your own AWS credentials and route Bedrock traffic through the gateway with 0% markup — you keep your AWS commitments and compliance posture while gaining cross-provider failover, caching, and unified analytics on top.",
	},
	{
		question: "Doesn't Bedrock already have OpenAI and Anthropic models?",
		answer:
			"It does — Bedrock hosts OpenAI's frontier models and Anthropic's Claude family, and Google's open-weight Gemma models arrived in 2026. But the catalog is limited to what AWS hosts: there's still no Google Gemini and no fast independent hosts like Groq or Cerebras. LLM Gateway routes across all of them, including Bedrock itself, from one API.",
	},
	{
		question: "How does pricing compare to AWS Bedrock?",
		answer: `Bedrock bills model-provider rates through your AWS account. LLM Gateway charges the same provider rates with a flat 5% platform fee on credits — or 0% when you bring your own provider keys, including AWS credentials. Optional full data retention is billed at ${MARKETING_STATS.dataStoragePrice}. Self-hosting the open-source gateway is free.`,
	},
	{
		question: "How hard is it to migrate from Bedrock to LLM Gateway?",
		answer:
			"Minimal effort. LLM Gateway exposes an OpenAI-compatible API, so most apps switch by changing the base URL and API key. There's no IAM policy work, model-access requests, or region planning — sign up, create a key, and every supported model is available immediately.",
	},
