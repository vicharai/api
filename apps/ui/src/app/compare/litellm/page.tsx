	{
		question: "What's the difference between LLM Gateway and LiteLLM?",
		answer:
			"LiteLLM is a self-hosted proxy you run and operate yourself. LLM Gateway is a production-ready gateway with a managed hosted option, a dashboard, real-time analytics, and automatic provider routing and fallback — so there's no infrastructure to run unless you want to self-host.",
	},
	{
		question: "Do I have to host it myself like LiteLLM?",
		answer:
			"No. You can use the fully managed gateway, or self-host the AGPLv3 build on your own infrastructure — the choice is yours.",
	},
	{
		question: "Is LLM Gateway open source?",
		answer:
			"Yes. The core gateway is AGPLv3 licensed and free to self-host forever, just like LiteLLM, while also offering a managed service.",
	},
	{
		question: "How does pricing work compared to LiteLLM?",
		answer: `Managed usage is pay-as-you-go with a flat 5% platform fee on credits, or free when you bring your own provider keys; optional full data retention is billed at ${MARKETING_STATS.dataStoragePrice}. Self-hosting the AGPLv3 build is free. LiteLLM's proxy is free to self-host, and its Enterprise tier (SSO, RBAC, audit logs, support) is quoted per deployment rather than per token.`,
	},
	{
		question: "What about the March 2026 LiteLLM supply-chain incident?",
		answer:
			"On March 24, 2026 two malicious litellm releases (1.82.7 and 1.82.8) reached PyPI and were pulled after about 40 minutes; they harvested credentials from unpinned pip installs. Pinned Docker deployments were unaffected, and LiteLLM shipped a hardened release pipeline with 1.83.0. The lesson applies to any self-hosted proxy, LLM Gateway included: pin versions and own the patch cycle, or use a managed gateway where that work is done for you.",
	},
	{
		question: "Does it provide analytics and routing out of the box?",
		answer:
			"Yes. Real-time cost and latency analytics, automatic provider routing and fallback, budgets and spend controls, and prompt caching are built in — no extra setup required.",
	},
	{
		question: "What are the best LiteLLM alternatives?",
		answer:
			"LLM Gateway is the most complete LiteLLM alternative: open source, self-hostable, and available as a managed cloud with zero markup on your own keys. Other options teams evaluate include OpenRouter (managed, no self-hosting), Bifrost (self-hosted Go proxy), and Portkey (enterprise governance).",
