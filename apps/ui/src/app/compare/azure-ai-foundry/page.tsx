		question: "Is Azure AI Foundry the same as Microsoft Foundry?",
		answer:
			"Yes. Microsoft renamed Azure AI Foundry to Microsoft Foundry at Ignite in November 2025, and the new name took effect in the January 2026 product terms. It is the same platform — Foundry resources, projects, deployments, and quota — with Anthropic's Claude models now generally available alongside OpenAI's, and a model router that can pick across OpenAI, Claude, and open-weight models. This page keeps its original URL so existing links and searches still land here.",
	},
	{
		question: "Is LLM Gateway a good Microsoft Foundry alternative?",
		answer:
			"Yes — if you want frontier models without committing to one cloud. LLM Gateway puts 200+ models from 40+ providers behind a single OpenAI-compatible API, with automatic routing, failover, caching, and per-request cost analytics. It's fully open source (AGPLv3) and self-hostable, and there are no deployments or TPM quotas to manage.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can I keep using Azure with LLM Gateway?",
		answer:
			"Yes. Azure OpenAI and Microsoft Foundry are built-in LLM Gateway providers. Bring your Azure credentials and route your Azure traffic through the gateway with 0% markup — you keep your Microsoft agreements and compliance posture while gaining cross-provider failover, caching, and unified analytics on top.",
	},
	{
		question: "Doesn't Foundry already have OpenAI and Claude models?",
		answer:
			"It does — Foundry hosts OpenAI's models and Anthropic's Claude family, among a large Azure-hosted catalog. But everything runs inside Azure: there's no Google Gemini and no fast independent hosts like Groq or Cerebras, and each model needs a deployment with quota. LLM Gateway routes across all of them, including Azure itself, from one API with no provisioning.",
	},
	{
		question: "How does pricing compare to Microsoft Foundry?",
		answer: `Foundry bills model rates through your Azure subscription, with provisioned-throughput (PTU) reservations for guaranteed capacity. LLM Gateway charges the same provider rates with a flat 5% platform fee on credits — or 0% when you bring your own provider keys, including Azure credentials. Optional full data retention is billed at ${MARKETING_STATS.dataStoragePrice}. Self-hosting the open-source gateway is free.`,
	},
	{
		question:
			"How hard is it to migrate from Microsoft Foundry to LLM Gateway?",
		answer:
			"Minimal effort. LLM Gateway exposes an OpenAI-compatible API, so most apps switch by changing the base URL and API key. There are no resources to create, models to deploy, or regional quotas to plan — sign up, create a key, and every supported model is available immediately.",
