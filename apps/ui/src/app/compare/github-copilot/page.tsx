		question: "Is LLM Gateway a GitHub Copilot alternative?",
		answer:
			"Yes, for chat and agentic coding. LLM Gateway routes any coding agent — Claude Code, Cline, Continue, Aider, or DevPass Code — to 200+ models with zero token markup, hard budget caps, and prompt caching. Copilot remains a fine choice for inline completions, which stay flat-fee.",
	},
	{
		question: "What changed with GitHub Copilot pricing in June 2026?",
		answer:
			"On June 1, 2026, GitHub replaced Premium Request Units with usage-based AI Credits (1 credit = $0.01). Base seats stayed at $10–$39 per user per month, but Copilot Chat, agent mode, code review, and CLI now bill by tokens consumed. On Business and Enterprise, paid additional usage is enabled by default; spend is only capped if an administrator disables the AI credit paid-usage policy or a budget has 'Stop usage when budget limit is reached' turned on (off by default), though user-level budgets always hard-stop. On Pro, Pro+, and Max, usage stops at the included credits until the user sets a budget. On September 1, 2026 the promotional allowances for existing Business ($30) and Enterprise ($70) customers reverted to the standard $19 and $39 per user.",
	},
	{
		question: "How much does GitHub Copilot cost after the change?",
		answer:
			"The seat price is unchanged — Pro $10, Pro+ $39, Max $100, Business $19, and Enterprise $39 per user per month — with included credits of $15, $70, $200, $19, and $39 respectively. Those run out fast under real usage: at 20 premium-model chat sessions a working day, our calculator estimates roughly $84 of AI Credits consumed per developer per month before any agent runs. Only consumption beyond the plan's included credits (or the organization's pooled credits) is billed as additional usage, subject to the paid-usage policy and budgets — see /copilot-cost-calculator for your own numbers.",
	},
	{
		question: "How does LLM Gateway keep AI coding costs predictable?",
		answer:
			"Provider token rates pass through with no markup (a flat 5% fee on credits, or 0% with your own provider keys), prompt caching cuts repeat-token spend automatically, and budgets with hard limits can be set per organization, project, and API key — so a runaway agent can never blow the budget.",
	},
	{
		question:
			"Can I keep Copilot for completions and use LLM Gateway for everything else?",
		answer:
			"Yes, that hybrid setup is common: keep a $10 Copilot Pro seat for inline completions, and route chat and agent workloads through LLM Gateway with a flat DevPass plan (from $29/month) or pay-as-you-go usage. You get frontier models at pass-through prices with a hard cap on spend.",
	},
	{
		question: "What are the best GitHub Copilot alternatives in 2026?",
		answer:
			"Teams leaving Copilot's usage billing typically evaluate LLM Gateway with the coding agent of their choice (DevPass Code, Claude Code, Cline, Continue, or Aider), plus flat-fee IDE products like Cursor and Windsurf. The right pick depends on whether you want an editor, an agent, or infrastructure you control.",
