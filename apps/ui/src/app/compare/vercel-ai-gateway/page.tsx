		question: "Is LLM Gateway a good Vercel AI Gateway alternative?",
		answer:
			"Yes. Both pass provider token rates through with zero markup and offer automatic failover and caching. The difference is portability: LLM Gateway is fully open source (AGPLv3) and self-hostable, and it isn't tied to a Vercel team account or deploy target.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can I self-host LLM Gateway? Vercel AI Gateway is managed-only.",
		answer:
			"Yes. The entire platform — gateway, dashboard, and worker — is AGPLv3 and runs on your own infrastructure with a single Docker image. Vercel AI Gateway is a managed cloud service with no self-host option.",
	},
	{
		question: "Does it work with the Vercel AI SDK?",
		answer:
			"Yes. LLM Gateway ships a first-class AI SDK provider (`@llmgateway/ai-sdk-provider`), so you keep using `generateText` and `streamText`. It also implements the AI SDK gateway protocol, so code that passes bare model strings can keep every line and just repoint the default gateway provider at LLM Gateway.",
	},
	{
		question: "How does pricing compare to Vercel AI Gateway?",
		answer: `Both charge no markup on tokens. On Vercel, bringing your own keys needs the paid tier, purchased credits expire after a year, and several controls bill on their own meters: custom reporting, a team-wide provider allowlist, team-wide zero data retention, and trace drains. On the managed tier LLM Gateway adds a flat 5% platform fee on credits, or 0% when you bring your own provider keys at any tier; optional full data retention is billed at ${MARKETING_STATS.dataStoragePrice}. Self-hosting the AGPLv3 build is free, and there are no governance add-ons gated behind a higher plan.`,
	},
	{
		question: "What can LLM Gateway do that Vercel AI Gateway doesn't?",
		answer:
			"Run on your own infrastructure under an open-source license, generate images and video through the same API, and use built-in guardrails (PII, prompt injection, jailbreak, secrets). Vercel's governance controls cover allowlists and data retention, not content scanning.",
	},
