verdict: "Cursor is the better buy if you want a finished AI editor — unlimited tab completion, the Composer agent and Bugbot, all in one app. DevPass isn't an editor: it's a single API key for 200+ models at provider rates, with roughly 3× the usage value of a Cursor plan, that drops into Claude Code, OpenCode, Zed — or Cursor itself. Pick Cursor for the all-in-one editor; pick DevPass to own your model access across every tool without lock-in."

faqs:
  - question: What is Cursor and how much does it cost?
    answer: "Cursor is an AI-native code editor — a VS Code fork with unlimited tab completion, the Composer agent, Bugbot code review and Cloud Agents built in. Individual plans are Pro at $20/mo (about $20 of model usage included), Pro Plus at $60/mo (~$70 included) and Ultra at $200/mo (~$400 included). Teams start at $40/user/mo. Beyond the included usage you continue at each model's API rate, pay-as-you-go."
  - question: Is DevPass a replacement for Cursor?
    answer: "Not exactly — they solve different problems. Cursor is the editor and the experience; DevPass is the model layer underneath. If you live inside Cursor for tab completion and Composer, DevPass doesn't replace that. But if your workflow is Claude Code, OpenCode, Zed or Cline, DevPass replaces the reason you'd pay Cursor: it gives you every model under one key, at provider rates, for a flat monthly price."
  - question: Can I use DevPass inside Cursor?
    answer: "Yes. DevPass exposes an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, so you can point Cursor's custom API key setting at it and run DevPass's 200+ models from inside the Cursor editor — while still getting per-request cost in real dollars and your flat-rate allowance. You keep Cursor's UX and swap in DevPass's catalog and pricing."
  - question: How does DevPass pricing compare to Cursor's?
    answer: "Cursor bundles usage into the plan: Pro is roughly break-even ($20 of usage for $20), and Ultra gives about 2× ($400 for $200). DevPass gives roughly 3× across every plan — you pay $79 on Pro and get about $237 of model usage at the providers' own published rates, metered transparently."
  - question: Does DevPass have tab completion or an agent like Cursor?
    answer: "DevPass doesn't ship its own editor, tab completion or Bugbot — that's Cursor's domain. Instead it lets you run any of 200+ models as the agent inside the tools you already use, including Claude Code, OpenCode and Cursor itself. If a bundled editor experience is what you want, Cursor wins; if model breadth, transparent pricing and no lock-in matter more, DevPass does."

## What is Cursor?

Cursor is an **AI-native code editor** — a polished VS Code fork built around AI from the ground up. You get unlimited **tab completion**, the **Composer** agent (Cursor's own coding model), **Bugbot** for automated code review, and Cloud Agents, all inside one app. Individual plans run **$20/mo (Pro)**, **$60/mo (Pro Plus)** and **$200/mo (Ultra)**, with team plans from **$40/user/mo**.

Each plan bundles a dollar amount of model usage — about $20 on Pro, ~$70 on Pro Plus, ~$400 on Ultra. Cursor runs two usage pools: a cheaper **Auto / Composer** pool for everyday agentic coding, and an **API** pool billed at each model's published rate. Cross the included amount and you continue pay-as-you-go at API rates.

What you're really buying with Cursor is **the experience**: a finished editor where the AI is woven into every keystroke.

## What is DevPass?

DevPass by LLM Gateway isn't an editor — it's the **model layer** underneath your editor. One API key unlocks **200+ models** — Claude Opus 4.8, GPT-5.5, Gemini 3.1 Pro, plus the open-weight coders like GLM, Kimi and Qwen — for a flat monthly price: **$29 (Lite)**, **$79 (Pro)** or **$179 (Max)**.

Instead of bundling usage into opaque credits, DevPass meters every request at the **provider's own published rate** and shows you the dollar cost in real time. The allowance is generous: roughly **$3 of model usage for every $1 you pay** (so ~$237 of usage on the $79 Pro plan). It plugs into anything OpenAI- or Anthropic-compatible — **Claude Code, OpenCode, Zed, Cline** — and even into **Cursor itself**.

## The real difference: an editor vs a model layer

This is the comparison in one line:

- **Cursor** is an **app**. You adopt its editor, and the models come bundled in. Brilliant if you want one finished tool that does everything — but you're inside Cursor, on Cursor's curated model set, with usage you can't see in plain dollars.
- **DevPass** is your **model access**. You keep whatever tools you already use and point them at one key for every model, at provider rates, with a transparent per-request bill — no editor lock-in.

Neither is strictly "better." They sit at different layers of your stack.

## Pricing: what your money actually buys

Cursor folds usage into the subscription. On **Pro**, $20/mo includes roughly $20 of API-rate usage — about break-even — though the cheaper Auto/Composer pool stretches it further for everyday work. **Ultra** gives the best ratio at about **2×** ($400 of usage for $200).

DevPass gives roughly **3× on every plan**, metered at the providers' published rates:

- **Lite — $29/mo** → ~$87 of model usage
- **Pro — $79/mo** → ~$237 of model usage
- **Max — $179/mo** → ~$537 of model usage

Every request shows its exact dollar cost in your dashboard, in real dollars, the moment it completes.

## Model catalog: 200+ vs a curated set

Cursor curates around **40 models** — the major Claude, GPT, Gemini and Grok releases, plus its own Composer. It's a tight, well-chosen list, but it's a list someone else picks.

DevPass carries **200+ models** under the same key, frontier and open-weight, and you choose freely per request — Claude for a hard refactor, GPT-5.5 for reasoning, GLM or Qwen when you want cheap throughput. No model is gated behind a different subscription.

## Can you use them together?

Yes — and it's often the smart move. Because DevPass is **OpenAI-compatible**, you can point Cursor's custom API key setting at DevPass and run all 200+ models from **inside the Cursor editor** you already like, while getting DevPass's provider-rate pricing and real-dollar cost dashboard. You keep Cursor's UX; you swap in DevPass's catalog and economics.

## Who should choose which

**Choose Cursor if** you want a finished AI editor — unlimited tab completion, the Composer agent, Bugbot review — and you're happy living inside one polished app with a curated model set.

**Choose DevPass if** you already work in Claude Code, OpenCode, Zed or Cline (or want to bring 200+ models into Cursor itself), and you value transparent provider-rate pricing, ~3× usage value, and zero model lock-in over a bundled editor experience.
