		question: "What if I hit the weekly premium allowance mid-week?",
		answer: `Redeem a Reset Pass: it instantly restores your full weekly premium allowance and starts a fresh 7-day window. A pass removes the weekly limit only — it doesn't add credits, so usage still draws from your monthly allowance. Pro includes ${DEV_PLAN_INCLUDED_RESET_PASSES.pro} pass per billing cycle and Max includes ${DEV_PLAN_INCLUDED_RESET_PASSES.max}; extra passes are a one-time purchase from your dashboard ($${DEV_PLAN_RESET_PASS_PRICES.lite} on Lite, $${DEV_PLAN_RESET_PASS_PRICES.pro} on Pro, $${DEV_PLAN_RESET_PASS_PRICES.max} on Max).

		question: "Does the weekly premium allowance reset when my plan renews?",
		answer:
			"Yes. Every monthly renewal resets everything at once: your monthly credits, your weekly premium allowance (a fresh 7-day window starts at renewal), and your included Reset Passes. Between renewals the window is rolling — when 7 days end, the next window starts with your next premium request, and redeeming a Reset Pass clears the window so the next request starts a fresh one. There's no reset schedule to manage — neither the weekly window nor unused included passes carry into the next cycle. Purchased Reset Passes are separate: they persist until redeemed.",
