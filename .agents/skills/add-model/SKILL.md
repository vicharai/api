name: add-model
description: Add a model or provider mapping to the catalogue, or verify one that was already written — pricing, capability and reasoning metadata, scoped e2e, and playground options for image/video models. Use when the user asks to add a named model on a provider, create a provider mapping, check model pricing, verify a model, or change packages/models/src/models.
---

# Add a model

Prove every declared value against the live provider. A wrong price mis-bills
every request until someone audits it; a wrong capability flag routes traffic to
a deployment that 400s. Values handed to you in a prompt or PR are unverified —
re-derive them.

## 1. Scope

List every `(model, provider, region)` triple that is new or changed. Regions in
a `regions: []` array are separate mappings with their own prices and e2e cases.
Report results per mapping at the end.

```bash
gh pr checkout <n>   # someone else's PR; sets the upstream too
git diff origin/main...HEAD -- packages/models/src/models/
```

## 3. Pricing

Billing is tokens: `calculateCosts` multiplies token counts by the mapping's
per-token prices, and no code path reads a provider-reported cost. So research
the per-token rate card, then verify the token semantics — the more common
failure.

**Rates.** Use the provider's current first-party pricing page or metadata
endpoint and record its units. Use aggregators only as a cross-check. Verify
cached rates, context-length bands, and regional rates independently; do not
derive or round them when the provider publishes exact values.

**Token semantics** — establish each from a live `usage` block:

- Reasoning inside `completion_tokens`? `costs.ts` keys this on the
  `completionIncludesReasoning` provider allowlist; a new provider that folds it
  in must be added there or output double-bills. Verify both streaming and
  non-streaming extraction. xAI is already special-cased to read
  `completion_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens`.
- Cached tokens inside `prompt_tokens`? `costs.ts` assumes yes and subtracts
  them.
- Cache writes priced (`cacheWriteInputPrice`, `cacheWriteInputPrice1h`)? A
  missing 1h rate silently bills 1h writes at the 5m rate.

**Reconcile.** Pin the provider and vary the prompt (Redis caches on the body):

```bash
curl -N "${GATEWAY_URL:-http://localhost:4001}/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer test-token" -H "x-no-fallback: true" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"<provider>/<model>","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]}'
```

For one small and one large request (crossing a tier boundary where there is
one): token counts must match between the upstream `usage` and the `log` row,
and a hand-computed cost must match `log.cost`. Where a provider echoes its own
cost, compare that too as a cross-check; it is not a billing input. Investigate
every mismatch instead of inferring a discount from its shape.

If a handed-in price, first-party rate card, and measurement disagree, reconcile
the units and token semantics before changing the catalogue. Do not choose one
without explaining the mismatch.

## 4. Metadata

Probe the deployment. The same model differs between providers, and an
`externalId` bump can silently drop a capability.

- `contextSize` / `maxOutput` — probe with an oversized prompt and read the
  rejection; listings under- and overstate.
- `vision` / `audio` / `document` — routing skips mappings lacking them. A
  deployment that 400s on images gets `vision: false`, never an error-text
  classification rule. `audio.e2e.ts` covers audio input.
- `supportedToolChoices` — probe `auto`, `none`, `required`, named function.
  Unlisted modes are downgraded to `auto`. Some deployments accept `required`
  only with thinking off.
- Capability combinations — probe tool calls and structured output with
  reasoning both enabled and disabled. If a capability only fails while
  reasoning is on, do not immediately flatten the mapping to `tools: false` or
  `jsonOutput: false`: first check `ProviderModelMapping` and request shaping
  for an existing conditional compatibility mechanism. If none can express the
  result, call out the gap instead of misrepresenting the standalone capability.
- `jsonOutput` / `jsonOutputSchema` — probe `json_object` and `json_schema`
  separately.
- `supportedParameters` — probe before declaring; omission elsewhere is not a
  claim of non-support.
- `supportsDeveloperRole` / `supportsAssistantPrefill` — default true, flip only
  on a 400.
- `serviceTiers` — declaring one narrows routing pre-flight.
- `stability: "unstable"` / `test: "skip"` for flaky, paid-per-call or
  region-locked mappings.
- `releasedAt`, plus an `output` entry per capability flag — both enforced by
  `model-metadata.spec.ts`.

Follow the catalogue comment rule in `AGENTS.md`: do not annotate pricing
choices, probe results, or restrictions already expressed by metadata. Put that
evidence in the PR body.

A new provider also needs a `providers.ts` entry, endpoint wiring in
`get-provider-endpoint.ts`, and possibly a `completionIncludesReasoning` entry.

## 5. Reasoning efforts

Efforts are forwarded as-is, so a declared tier the upstream rejects is a 4xx for
users, and each declared tier becomes an e2e case. Probe `none | minimal | low |
medium | high | xhigh | max` individually and declare the accepted subset in
ascending order — docs and reality diverge often, including between chat
completions and the Responses API.

| Toggle                                     | Field                                |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Standard effort tiers                      | `reasoningEfforts` alone             |
| Thinks by default, vLLM chat-template flag | `chatTemplateThinkingKey: "<key>"`   |
| Off by default, needs an enable flag       | `requiresEnableThinking: true`       |
| Off only via `thinking: {type:"disabled"}` | `requiresDisableThinkingParam: true` |
| Explicit token budget                      | `reasoningMaxTokens: true`           |
| Anthropic adaptive thinking                | `reasoningMode: "adaptive"`          |
| Reasons but returns no reasoning content   | `reasoningOutput: "omit"`            |

Verify the toggle takes effect rather than just returning 200 — a provider can
accept `enable_thinking: false` and still return `reasoning_content`. Declare it
only on mappings where it works.

## 6. Image, video, and other endpoints

Probe the size/quality/duration grid; rate cards list tiers deployments refuse.
Leave rejected values off the mapping and record the accepted grid in the PR.

**Video** — `supportedVideoSizes`, `supportedVideoDurationsSeconds`,
`supportedVideoDurationsSecondsImageToVideo`, `supportsVideoAudio`,
`supportsVideoWithoutAudio`, `perSecondPrice`, model-level
`maxVideoDurationSeconds`. The studio derives its menus from those, but
frame/reference input is gated by hardcoded allowlists in
`mappingSupportsVideoRequest` and the `supportsVideoFrameInput` /
`supportsVideoReference*Input` helpers — add the model there, matched on root
model id, never `externalId`. Cover it in `video-gen.spec.ts`.

**Image** — `perImagePrice` (keyed by resolution, or `"<quality>/<resolution>"`
when both are priced), or `imageOutputPrice` + `imageOutputTokensByResolution`;
`imageInputPrice` / `imageInputTokensByResolution` for edit models;
`imageInputRequired` when it cannot run text-only. A `perImagePrice` map without
a `"default"` key falls back to its most expensive tier, so a wrong key
overcharges silently. `getModelImageConfig` contains hardcoded model-id logic;
inspect and update it when its defaults do not match the new deployment. If a
newly priced knob isn't forwarded by
`prepare-request-body.ts`, you price tiers you never serve. Cover it in
`image-gen.spec.ts` and `costs.spec.ts`.

| Flag                | Prices                                                       | e2e                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `imageGenerations`  | above                                                        | `images.e2e.ts`         |
| `embeddings`        | input tokens only                                            | `embeddings.e2e.ts`     |
| `speechGenerations` | `outputAudioPrice`, `inputCharacterPrice`, `supportedVoices` | `speech.e2e.ts`         |
| `transcriptions`    | `inputAudioHourPrice`                                        | `transcriptions.e2e.ts` |
| `ocr`               | `ocrPagePrice`                                               | `ocr.e2e.ts`            |
| `rerank`            | token prices                                                 | `rerank.e2e.ts`         |

`realtime` has no e2e file — it is covered by `apps/gateway/src/realtime/*.spec.ts`
plus `realtime-models.spec.ts`, which fails any realtime mapping missing its
per-modality token prices. `realtimeTranscription` only on token-metered ASR
mappings.

Image and video are the one docs exception to never enumerating models: update
`apps/docs/content/(gateway)/features/{image,video}-generation.mdx`.

## 7. Verify

Use the `verify` skill to launch an isolated stack so another worktree cannot
corrupt the run.

The gateway resolves models from the catalogue, so a rebuild is enough for API
requests. The playground and dashboard read the DB via `/internal/models`, so
run `pnpm seed` before expecting a new model in any UI.

```bash
pnpm build:core
pnpm exec vitest run --no-file-parallelism \
  packages/models/src/model-metadata.spec.ts \
  packages/models/src/providers.spec.ts \
  packages/models/src/realtime-models.spec.ts \
  apps/gateway/src/lib/costs.spec.ts

TEST_MODELS="<provider>/<model>" FULL_MODE=true pnpm test:e2e
```

Add the relevant action and Playground specs when those files changed. Run all
tests against the isolated database required by `AGENTS.md`.

- For mapping-only changes, the scoped local run is the only relevant e2e
  result. Never run e2e without `TEST_MODELS` or trigger the GitHub e2e
  workflow. Failures outside the selected mappings, including failures from an
  accidentally triggered full run, do not affect acceptance or auto-merge.
  Once every selected mapping passes, e2e has passed for the change.
- Scope e2e with `TEST_MODELS`, and don't invoke the `*.e2e.ts` files one by
  one. It overrides `test: "skip"`, takes regions as `provider/model:region`,
  and fails loudly when an entry matches no mapping.
- `FULL_MODE=true` expands the per-effort cases and includes free models.
- `pnpm test:e2e` loads `.env` automatically. Use credentials already
  configured in `.envrc` or `.env`; never inspect or invoke password managers
  or other credential stores, and never retrieve provider secrets manually.
- API key env names aren't derivable from the provider id — read
  `env.required` from `providers.ts`. Vertex provider variants use different
  credentials, and keys can be region-scoped; do not infer either from the
  provider display name.
- e2e asserts shape, not cost — the §3 reconciliation is the only pricing check.

For image/video models, open the studio and confirm the offered
sizes/qualities/durations match exactly what the deployment accepted in §6.

## 8. When something fails

| Symptom                                       | Cause                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| JSON output cases fail                        | deployment rejects `response_format`; set `jsonOutput: false` and drop it from `supportedParameters`       |

| Forced tool_choice 400s                       | narrow `supportedToolChoices`                                                                              |
| Vision case 400s                              | `vision: false` on that mapping                                                                            |
| Cost ~2x the provider's on reasoning requests | reasoning double-counted — add the provider to `completionIncludesReasoning`                               |
| Cost far below on reasoning requests          | reasoning tokens never extracted (nested `completion_tokens_details`)                                      |
| Cost mismatch only on long prompts            | wrong or missing `pricingTiers` band                                                                       |
| Manual curl hits the wrong provider           | missing `x-no-fallback: true`                                                                              |
| `max_tokens` case returns no content          | reasoning spends the whole budget; declare the tiers the deployment actually honours in `reasoningEfforts` |

If a failure predates the change, fix what's in scope and say in the PR that it
also fails on `main`.

A failing case is a metadata or gateway fix, never a reason to retire a mapping
that still serves live requests. Before writing `deactivatedAt`, apply the
7-day notice rule in `AGENTS.md`.

## 9. Finish

`pnpm format`, `pnpm build`, conventional title, then the `pull-request` skill.

Never merge — and never enable auto-merge on — a mapping that does not actually
work: it could not serve a live request, or its scoped e2e fails with no fix
available from our side. `test: "skip"` removes a mapping from default e2e
selection; `stability: "unstable"` also removes it from normal routing. Neither
makes the model work. Say plainly that it does not work and why, leave the PR
open, and hand the merge decision to the user. Same for prices nobody could
verify.

The PR body carries the evidence:

- Per mapping: external id, prices, context, max output, capabilities.
- How each price was verified — rates, token counts, hand-computed cost,
  `log.cost`.
- Reasoning tiers accepted vs rejected; for image/video, the accepted grid.
- The scoped e2e command and its result per mapping.
- Anything corrected from the handed-in values, with both numbers.
- Anything not verified, and why.

Follow `AGENTS.md` for PR screenshots. Catalogue and Playground-only changes do
not create a dashboard screenshot requirement; scoped e2e and the accepted
image/video grid are the evidence.
